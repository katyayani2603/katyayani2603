Speaker2 : No. So I would have lost the money. I guess you guys who would have just charged me $20 a year or you know what, would have just stayed with you.
Speaker3 : Just stay with you.
Speaker1 : Oh, you mean if you're not aware that this was rolled over to us technically? yes, sir, because you will be charged $20 a year.
Speaker2 : Okay, so you guys would have just sent me a notification that you were going to have to charge me $20 basically.
Speaker1 : I'm sorry, the notification we sent to you is something like for you to be aware that your account is with us.
Speaker2 : Okay, so. I don't think that you understood my question. That's all right. So all I have to do is you're going to send me an email and there's a link there for me to go and claim the account and take action.
Speaker3 : Take action. That's correct. I just sent you the email. Try to check it if you did receive it.

Speaker1 : You got here $171 and $0.63
Speaker2 : $171, $71? Yes, and $0.63. So just a question for you. At one point there was $1000 in there. Just curious how that went down. Do you show the history?
Speaker1 : Let me check. Based on what we received from your previous employer, it is $188.10. That's the amount that was rolled over to us.
Speaker2 : So one 80 eights, all that was rolled over.
Speaker1 : And by the way, once you're done with this process, once you're done claiming the account, you will receive like a welcome email from us within three business days. It can be earlier or later. So keep an eye on your email. Once you have that, there will be a link attached to it that you can click so you will be routed to the portal and decide on what to do with the account.
Speaker2 : Okay, thank you.

Speaker2 : Hi, this is Rochelle. I probably need to speak with a supervisor, but I'll go ahead and tell you my story. I received a letter from you guys saying that you had a 401 K of mine and from. One of my jobs from my last job. And that you put it in an Ira until I. Got a hold of To tell you what to do with it. So I called and I wanted, I wanted the money out and I was on the phone with the lady and she was going through it. I was doing it online on my laptop. Going through it And I was having them. Send the bank card, the prepaid card, because I didn't have a bank that they would use. So I did that and I've been waiting, waiting and it's been like 25 days. So I called. The other day because I actually had another account from another job. That two days ago I got on there and I got that into my new bank account, which I got last night. But they're telling me that this account is closed and that I only had $100 in there and I really had $303.46. And they're telling me it's just, it's closed and it's gone and there was never a distribution made. And that's not TRUE. So we need to figure out where my money is and I want my money. So there's the problem.
Speaker1 : Okay, let's see here. So in this case, what is your last name?
Speaker2 : Crumble T R U M. B L E
Speaker1 : Thank you, Miss Rumble. Where is the last four digits of your social?

Speaker1 : Do you remember the previous employers' name?
Speaker2 : This one was for Lance Soft.
Speaker1 : Okay, maybe you have a different one.
Speaker2 : Yeah, and then I had one from Freedom Financial.
Speaker1 : And the last question, what is your phone number?
Speaker2 : 480 434. 7087.
Speaker1 : Okay, 480-424-7087, correct?
Speaker2 : 7087.
Speaker1 : Okay, thank you. So yes, in this case I see an account that it's closed. It was closed today, the rollover traditional Ira account. See you selected an Ach to your bank.
Speaker2 : Correct.
Speaker1 : So basically. If you have, did you already receive the money in your bank?
Speaker2 : I did for that account. Yes. It's the other account that I'm having an issue with.
Speaker1 : Another account Let me see here. So basically in this account it was closed because of balance. It was closed on May 22, 2025. Yeah.
Speaker2 : And why was it closed?
Speaker1 : Because of the balance I had 300.
Speaker2 : I have the paper that I'm looking at right now says. I had $303.46 in there. And I was on the phone with the lady and I said, I want my money. And we were going through, like I said, I was going through online where she was telling me what to do to get the money. and I still haven't got the money. And now all of a sudden the account's closed.
Speaker1 : $303.46. So that money is for the account that it was closed today and you got the money in your bank account. Keep in mind that of course you are not going to get the 300 at $3 because we have some fees like the closing fee, $10.25.
Speaker2 : Well, yeah, I got that, but this is for the land soft one, not the freedom financial one. So if you were to take the $25 for me to get the distribution, the $10, whatever closing fee, I would still have 200 and something.
Speaker1 : Well, in this case, let me Check something here. This account, that account that you are seeing on the paper is the same account that you got the money in your bank.
Speaker2 : Well, why is it saying lands soft then and not the freedom financial? Because I have a card that you guys sent me for Freedom Financial, just a card thing. And then I have an actual letter. From you guys for my land soft. So I had two accounts and they both probably had $300 in it.
Speaker1 : That is correct. How much is. That is correct. So.
Speaker2 : Then why I not getting my money.
Speaker1 : Okay, so you have two accounts. The 1st one, as you told me, for freedom and the 2nd one for lands of. Correct. Correct. So The 1st one for freedom, it was closed because of the love balance. It was no freedom was no freedom was the one that I just.
Speaker2 : Got the distribution from
Speaker1 : The one you got the distribution is from Lens.
Speaker2 : Lands is the one I'm having my issue with. I had money in there. The lady, the day I talked to her, like 25 days ago, the lady I talked to told me, Y, you have $303 or however much it was. And here's how you do it. There you get online. This is how you do it to get your money. And I had to do it. I picked the prepaid card and never received it. And now the account's closed.
Speaker1 : No, the money that you just got, it was from the lens of the 243 and 59. That is from lanes of Reason why you didn't receive any money from Freedom is because it was closed because of low balance. You didn't have enough. Money in this account so it was closed because of La Balance. So that's why you only received the money from.
Speaker2 : So how much was in that one?
Speaker1 : For the freedom or length of freedom. For freedom. How much was in there when you guys closed it? Can be secure on one It was 2670.
Speaker2 : It was what
Speaker1 : $26.70
Speaker2 : I'm sorry you cut out. I didn't hear it.
Speaker1 : $26.70. $26.70. Yes. Of course you didn't have enough money. Closed the account. So that's why you didn't receive any money from Freedom.
Speaker2 : Well, I don't understand why then. They told me yesterday it was. The freedom one Or two days ago. And the lands one wasn't
Speaker1 : Right. Maybe they didn't. Tell you in a correct way, but I am thinking my system that the money you got is from lane stuff. Okay, okay.
Speaker2 : All right. Thank you.

Speaker2 : It's been switched.

Speaker1 : It would have been An Ach.
Speaker2 : Ach, okay. And it was sent when the data was.
Speaker1 : If there's a I was about to say it posted to my account today, but. I am using the same bank from which it was delivered, so it may not have posted yet, but it should post today.
Speaker2 : Okay, but you know that it came out two, three days ago.
Speaker1 : Four days ago. Issue I approved it yesterday for delivery today.
Speaker2 : Ach. Yesterday. Okay, 1 s. I'm working with our deposit team to confirm some things. Okay, thank you. Hello.
Speaker1 : Yes.
Speaker2 : Thank you for your patience. It's been brought to my attention that we receive Ach payments within three to four business days. It probably just hasn't hit his account yet. That doesn't mean it's not on his way. I also wanted to confirm if you're able. The Ach instructions that you have for Inspired Financial. Did he give you updated Ach information?
Speaker1 : I got an email late last night from his wife with that information.
Speaker2 : Okay.
Speaker1 : I do now have it, but that was not what we used.
Speaker2 : Well, I would potentially want to circle back and correct that information to make sure that it was sent to. The right to coin bank. that's been an issue with the whole merger and transition. Some people are still using old information and we're not always collecting the funds. And that could be why we haven't received it yet, but I would check back to see that the Ach information is updated.
Speaker1 : Okay, but Understand that The Ach was already submitted to the old New View bank account information.
Speaker2 : They're going to reject that then. And it'll be sent back.
Speaker1 : Right, right. Yeah.
Speaker2 : Because we're not Inspire doesn't have that bank account or any of that information that it was sent to. So they're going to reject that. No.
Speaker1 : Okay.
Speaker2 : No, so they they should reject that payment that was sent.
Speaker1 : Okay. I'll have my controller follow up with them and then. Redistribute that to the correct information.
Speaker2 : Thank you. Okay, so you have high confidence it will be rejected then I do. It would also be advantageous to just call to have it voided. But yes, I suspect that they'll go ahead and reject. Now, how long it takes for them to reject it, I don't know. It could just sit in their office for a minute.

Speaker1 : Hi, how are you?
Speaker2 : I am well, ma'am, thank you for holding. My name is Tasha. So Jose transferred you over. He stated, you have some questions regarding Mr. Erikson's account here. How can I help you with that now?
Speaker1 : So Mr. Erickson is my dad and. I have financial power of attorney for my mom and so I've been helping her gather all of his. Iras and 401 Ks and things like that. And this I think. I am working with my dad's mutual fund guy and my mom, of course. To get inspired, consolidated into the Iras that they currently have. And the person I'm working with has asked if we can get a statement. Because there's some questions in here that he's trying to help us answer about. I don't know what his questions were specifically. But he had said that if I could get a statement, it would be helpful. To know the account number because I don't have that to know how much there is because I know roughly how much it is, but we haven't seen a statement. And some other information, I guess.
Speaker2 : Okay, so allow me just a moment, Miss Barbera. What I'll do is review the account. If you don't mind, I'll place on a brief hold while I do that to see exactly what it is we may need for you to do in order to obtain a statement from us.
Speaker1 : Yeah. That would be really helpful. I mean, I've been asked, I submitted his death certificate in April and then I was asked for it again as if it was never received. So I just submitted it again and then. The guy, our mutual fund guy, is kind of puzzled as to why like I'm being asked to submit. His marriage certificate, his birth certificate, like all of these things which I got original copies of. And I'm happy to provide them, but it's just kind of weird as to why my mom is of course the beneficiary. They were married for 46 years, so I'm not quite sure why we're having to jump through all of these hoops. The other Iras were not. This challenging
Speaker2 : Understood, Miss Barbara, I definitely understand your concern with that, but That is us verifying the information before we're able to release the funds out. So that is why we're requesting all this additional information here. So allow me just a moment. I'll place you on a brief hold for about two to 5 min. I'll fully review the account here to see exactly what needs to be done so you're able to obtain a statement from us.
Speaker1 : Thank you.
Speaker2 : All right, thank you. I'll be just a moment. Barbera
Speaker1 : Yes.
Speaker2 : Thank you so much for holding for me, ma'am. I apologize for your wait there. So to obtain a statement, we would need for either you or your mother to write us a handwritten letter requesting that statement. Now if it is coming from you, we would need a copy of your Id. Or driver's license as well as a copy of your birth certificate. If the letter is coming from your mother. Need a copy of her Id and her marriage certificate.
Speaker1 : Okay.
Speaker2 : You can send it in to us via email. Or it can be faxed to us.
Speaker1 : Okay. All right. So, and what does the letter need to say exactly? Why handwritten? That's interesting.
Speaker2 : It has to be handwritten with a web signature there. So you have to physically sign that for us. So within the letter, you're just stating basically exactly what it is you're requesting from us. If it's just a statement that's showing the full account number, then you'll see that within the body of that letter that that is what you're requesting. You'll also include within the body how you're wanting us to get the information. To you. So if it's via email, you'll include your email address. If it's via fax or physical mail, you just include that information there.
Speaker1 : Okay. Yeah, I'll probably do email. My mom will more than likely not be writing the letter. It'll be me. She has been diagnosed with early dementia and so she's like, that's a little bit past her wheelhouse. Hence, I mean, why I have power of attorney too. So In the letter So I'll request the account number, I'll request the total and. I guess Is there any other information that would be, I guess I should call the mutual fund guy and ask him what he needs specifically, but is there anything else that would be relevant to request, do you think?
Speaker2 : I don't think so. Usually what they're asking for is a statement. A statement usually includes all the information that they're looking for, the balance, the full account number. Exactly how the funds are being held, things of that nature. So that is one of the reasons why we need that verifying information. Because you guys are asking for account specific information here.
Speaker1 : And you need My Id and then my birth certificate.
Speaker2 : Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am, and it must show your father's name listed on your birth certificate.
Speaker1 : Okay, I mean, I'm sure it does. I don't see why it wouldn't, but. yeah. Okay. If for some reason It doesn't, I mean, I haven't looked at my birth certificate in years, probably. If for some reason it doesn't say his name, which I mean, I have a seven year old daughter and my husband was there. I put her, you know, there's no reason why my dad's name wouldn't be there. But if I run into that issue, then what?
Speaker2 : Then you will have to obtain a copy that holds his name there. And that is something you will have to go through the courts for, I believe. There is a process for that.
Speaker1 : Well, I'm Gd. My parents were on good terms when I was born because otherwise I'd really be up Shit Creek, wouldn't I?
Speaker2 : You would be surprised, ma'am.
Speaker1 : What's that?
Speaker2 : I say you would be surprised some of the things we get in here and the questions we get asked as to why this information needs to be provided. So we just have to be very clear. When we're advising here what it is that we're looking for. So that is the reason why I had to advise that we have to have, well, we have to see your father's name on your birth certificate here. Oh yeah, listen, I get it. I mean, you know, no one wants to be asked for the same information twice. I mean, I've had to jump through so many hoops.
Speaker1 : You know, for so many other things. So like when I got another request for his death certificate, I was a little like. Why I submitted this months ago. And my mom, I mean, part of the reason why I have financial power of attorney is because my mom. Since October 2023 has been the victim of scammers and we're hitting 80 grand now. And I have changed her number four times. I've gotten her a kid's phone. finally that like whitelist and blacklist numbers, which seems to be solving a lot of it. But you know, she has this. I don't know what this behavior is all about. But anyway, I get it, you know, and I appreciate, you know. The safeguards put in place because these people People are shady, they know what they're doing. So I will get this to you as soon as possible. And we'll go from there.
Speaker2 : All right, do you have any additional questions for me, Miss Barbara?
Speaker1 : No, I don't think so. Thank you though.

Speaker2 : Yes.
Speaker1 : Okay, thank you, Miss Germaine. Okay, so. Let me see. Okay, and how can I assist?
Speaker2 : Well, I spoke to two people on Friday afternoon. Regarding my son's account in that they had advised me that the power of attorney had been approved by your legal team for our son and they were going to be sending us some paperwork. They did that via email. We were not able to open it. So what they were going to be sending us is. Brian, can you pull up that? It was a form that we needed to sign for the power of attorney, I guess. And then they were also sending us a distribution documentation as well because we are looking to move this money over into an account, another account that my son has. And so I just wanted to verify if those documents have been mailed. Because again, this is just the time sensitive and I don't know why we're not able to open them. We're able to open. Documentation from where we're trying to move the money to. So I'm not quite sure why we're not able to open it.
Speaker1 : Okay, let's see.
Speaker2 : It was a transfer instruction form and. Then another No, that's what we sent them. And it was an Ira form. Instructions for Ira. DR. Transfer Yeah, it was an affidavit for power the China click on it, you just get an error message.

Speaker1 : Yeah, this was something that you would have to open up on. Through your email.
Speaker2 : Okay. Is it a form that can be mailed to us if we can't seem to open it? Yeah, there we go. Yeah.
Speaker1 : Yeah, that's fine.
Speaker2 : Can you tell in the notes if it was requested that they be mailed to us?
Speaker1 : Could you hold on? Let me see. Oh, you already requested for it to be mailed, you said.
Speaker2 : Yes, on Friday we received both of these forms via email, the Ira form and the Inspire affidavit fora. We couldn't open up form on Friday. For some reason, we were able to open up the Po affidavit and we printed that off so we can fill that out.
Speaker1 : Now I do see that I got your email. Yeah, it does appear that we did actually send it out. Yeah, we did send it out. It looks like it was sent out yesterday. Okay, perfect, perfect. Then I'll just wait and yeah, we can't, we still can't open up the Ira for me. Just like I said, gives us this weird error message that says the server failed.

Speaker1 : Perfect. Thank you for all your information. So here we have your account. This is a lower traditional Ira. And now just to confirm, you told me that you had issues to complete the process to register online.
Speaker2 : Yes, because my Ids don't match my driver's license doesn't say what my. I haven't switched over my driver's license to my new address. I moved from Texas to Virginia and. My Ids don't match so I can't confirm anything online.
Speaker1 : Okay, but Let me check some information here. Let me just Two or 3 min on the line while I check your account. Okay.
Speaker2 : Okay, thank you.
Speaker1 : My pleasure Thank you for holding
Speaker2 : Yes.
Speaker1 : Okay, perfect. So. I understand that you don't have the driver license with your current address, but maybe you don't have any. Like utility bill, a paycheck. Maybe other document that has your current address.
Speaker2 : The only thing I have is other credit card statements.
Speaker1 : The Let me check if we accept that here there is a unique. Document that you have. Okay, it works the credit card statement, it works for the address verification so you can send that to verify your address and complete the process. Of the claiming of your account.
Speaker2 : Okay. What credit card statements work? Because it still wants my Id, but the I D is not going to match the credit card statement.
Speaker1 : Well, On your credit card statement, you have your current address. That is that we need to verify.
Speaker2 : I'm sorry.
Speaker1 : On your credit card statement. Do you have your current address? That is the one that we need to verify. Yes. Why do I have to do all this? This is my account. I don't understand why I have to do all this. I did not ask for it to be sold. I just want to be able to access my account. This is ridiculous. I've given you my social security number. I've given you my driver's license.
Speaker2 : I just want to access my money.
Speaker1 : Well, there is a process that we always make.
Speaker2 : I didn't have to do this when I set up the account. And I didn't ask for all this, so I don't understand why this is so difficult. It's my money. I'd like to be able to access it.
Speaker1 : Will provide you the access once we verify all the information. In this case, we missed the address verification. That's why we need that. After that, you will be able to get access to your account online.
Speaker2 : This is ridiculous. This is absolutely ridiculous. Credit cards do not make you DR. through this many hoops to do something like this.
Speaker1 : Well, I understand your body, how inspired works to verify the account. So we need that to continue with the process.
Speaker2 : So is the credit card statement going to work even though my Id says a different address on it?
Speaker1 : Yeah, because I need to verify the address. So if you have on your credit card statement the current address, that is that we need.
Speaker2 : So how do I upload this on the account? Because it wants my Id and it says whatever I submit needs to match my Id on the address and it's not going to match.
Speaker1 : For that reason, we have other documents that work. Verify your identity. So in this case, the credit card statement works for that process where it has your address.
Speaker2 : So What do I need to do? How do I get on and verify the credit card statement? How do I access And verify the credit card statement.
Speaker1 : Well, If you don't have that, then you need to contact your bank where you have your credit card payments. So. We don't have that information that is from your. Company where you have your credit card.
Speaker2 : I'm asking you, how do I access this online to prove my credit card statement is the current address?
Speaker1 : Oh, well, you can send that by email. Mail or fax. I can send you an email with the three ways or the information of the three ways of how you can send that to us.
Speaker2 : I'd like to speak to a manager, please.
Speaker1 : Okay, well he will provide you the same information.

Speaker1 : Okay, well, 1st of which I do apologize, but we don't have an option to request for a distribution over the phone because you would need to fill out a distribution.

I'll send that one to your email address that you have and you need to complete that one. It would then be sent to our team to be processed for you to receive the withdrawal of your funds.

We ask the name of the employer to the customers because we need to enter it into the system and the system tell us if it is correct or not, but we are not able to see which company exactly. Opened this account. I can tell you when the account was opened. Can you tell me the last time money was put into the account? Absolutely, sir.

Speaker4 : December 2 of 2019.
Speaker2 : Correct. That's when the account was sent to us by the previous employer.
Speaker1 : Okay, so that was opened by the previous employer, but no money has been put in since 2019.
Speaker2 : Correct, sir, because when the previous employer, not necessarily your company, but any employer, sends the information and becomes an Ira, that means that the only person that can deposit money into the account is the owner of the account, which in this case is you.
Speaker4 : Huh? If I say another name, will you be able to confirm it?
Speaker5 : Yep.
Speaker4 : Cal State University, Los Angeles.

Speaker4 : I have no idea who it is. I haven't worked for anybody other than Cal State University, Los Angeles. In 2000. Well, it could have been Pepperdine University.
Speaker3 : No, sir, as well. It is not valid. So
Speaker4 : I haven't worked for anybody other than those two since 2019. Okay, don't worry. Moving to the next question, sir, related to the address.

Speaker4 : About 11011 hundred dollars.

Speaker4 : I wonder who that was. Well, whoever it is, am I able to roll that money over? To another traditional Ira because I have I have a traditional Ira with chase.

It will not be done through the website. It will be done through another process. But I will, I will send you the instructions.

Speaker3 : The process Is like this.

When I was filling out my form that the Inspire paperwork says my account type is a traditional Ira. And It concerns me because I'm trying to go from a four, you know, move funds from a 401 K. Into all this time I thought to another 401 K or at least self directed 401 K. But I don't know if this is going to cause issues because it says it's a traditional Ira.
Speaker1 : Yeah, you can roll over from. It's just the Roth is different. When you're doing that, you got to do a conversion. But Saps, traditional 401 Ks, you can roll in and out of those and other. Similar Type of retirement plants and those are all taxed the same So. There shouldn't be a problem with that.
Speaker2 : Okay. So no penalties, anything like that. To roll from the 401 K plan into the traditional Okay, now my next question is. When I fill out my 5500, I've been including. Both our Schwab 401 K and our new view. Ira Combining the assets onto my 50 500. Is that correct? Or Am I not supposed to because one's called an Ira? I'm assuming I should because. What you're saying is They're basically the same thing.
Speaker1 : Yeah, but. I'm not familiar with the 50 500 form, so. I wouldn't even know how to answer that for you. Okay. Is that It's in disclosure too.
Speaker2 : It's the annual return of the one participant.
Speaker1 : Yeah, I'm looking that up right now.
Speaker2 : Retirement plan I mean, I kind of feel like I should because.
Speaker1 : I don't even know who I'd transfer you to. You'd really need to speak to someone outside of Inspire like a, you know, a tax professional or. An accountant just to see what's correct.
Speaker2 : Yeah. But do you see what I'm saying though? If you're rolling money. From one to the other to me. And you're saying there's no penalty associated with it. Then to me it's kind of the same plan.
Speaker1 : Yeah. You can even Google that where. Rolling in and out of 401 Ks, traditional Iras, Saps, all those that's allowed. I wouldn't expect there to be any reporting for that. It's going into the same pre tax plan or after tax plan, you know, that similar. Tax consequences. So I would ask See, I wish I could ask someone here, but they're going to tell me the same thing I'm telling you is to get help from an accountant or a tax professional because the departments here deal with the specific investments.
Speaker2 : Right. Yeah.
Speaker1 : I'm reading all this now. Yeah, I just, I'm sorry. Yeah, we just don't deal with tax forms.
Speaker2 : Yeah, well, no worry. I mean, I've always included it and I don't think it's just an information return. There's no tax associated with it. So I hate to reinvent the wheel and now stop in.
Speaker1 : Yeah, I don't guess it can hurt to show more than I don't know. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, well, sorry, I can't help you there. That's okay, but I appreciate your help with this though. Thank you so much. Yeah, and I'm also going to open a case on your account. It looks like. Your account is frozen. For fees, but you don't owe anything. So I will open a case just to. Change that status on your account.
Speaker2 : Okay. You might want to check my husband's because I was calling about his too, but you answered it, but. See if he has the same issue. It's Richard Lee, 1613173.
Speaker1 : Okay, make sure it's not.
Speaker2 : Got an issue with that either.

Speaker1 : It's a sweep account. So I guess when I requested the statement, because fidelity needed a statement, but.

Speaker1 : It, Ira
Speaker2 : Okay, gotcha. So then what it is is that you don't really don't have to do anything on our end here. What it is is that George from Fidelity, he's going to send paperwork to us. To start the process. What I can do if it's okay with you, Ron, is I can send you some transfer instructions to your email. These instructions you would forward to George, and then George will follow these instructions to send the paperwork to us to start the process. Once we receive the paperwork and everything's in good order, we send a check directly to Fidelity at George and then this account gets closed.

Speaker1 : Yeah, I was wondering. If I requested a statement, like a full statement, because like I said, I requested one before, but it wasn't a full statement. Is that because it's a sweep account or? Should I have received a full statement with the holdings and the name and the account number and all that type of stuff?
Speaker2 : I can send one out to you with the full account number, sir. I shouldn't have any problem. Is it okay for me to send one to your email?

Speaker5 : Okay, give me a moment. Okay, so it says assets pending. Give me a moment. Let me take a look.
Speaker2 : Okay.
Speaker5 : Okay, so it looks like we did sign it and it has been approved, so we should be sending it over to the process. And actually the last note on that was the 25th. That would have been Friday. So it looks like it's processing. It just has not. Let me see, transfer of cash from Schwa requested. A cat has been canceled. It says that's a note from today.
Speaker2 : Oh, I just, I called Schwab like right before we called you and they said it wasn't in the system yet or whatever. That the Ira, Ira form wasn't, they didn't have it.
Speaker4 : Monique, you're still there.
Speaker6 : Hello.
Speaker5 : I'm still here. Yeah, I'm still here.
Speaker6 : I
Speaker5 : Yes, I'm not sure, but yeah, that's the last note.
Speaker4 : I'm sorry to clarify. You said the last note is that Schwab canceled the request.
Speaker5 : Yeah, so the note in here was transfer of cash from swab requested on 07:29 via a cat has been canceled.
Speaker1 : So I'm not sure why. Let me see if I can get a reason for that. because we find it. Incoming transfer and it was approved for a Capps on the 25th. So I'm not sure. Let me see what I can find out. Okay.
Speaker4 : Thank you.
Speaker1 : All right, thank you so much, Hannah. Thank you.
Speaker3 : Thank you so much for holding. I do apologize about the way so the processor confirmed that they haven't gotten the report back to see why it says that it was canceled, but they will reach out to you as soon as they get the details.
Speaker2 : So it was canceled on their end or is that on your end?
Speaker3 : So I don't, it doesn't tell me. So I asked him why he said he hasn't received the daily report from Us bank. So I'm assuming it would be on our, we submitted it, we've already approved and submitted it, so it would have to be on their end for some reason. but he can't see why. So once we get that back. They will follow up with you.
Speaker2 : Okay. So they'll call me or what do they do usually email.
Speaker3 : It's either phone call or email. It depends on the workload. What's the best phone number for you?
Speaker2 : 2245882. 88.
Speaker3 : And preferred email
Speaker2 : Jim Mccarthy. At gmail.com
Speaker3 : Okay, all right. both of those are what we have on file. Okay, They will reach out to you once we get a reason for that.
Speaker4 : Question for you once the reason comes in, whatever the reason is, that if it can be fixed relatively easily. Does the form then get resent by your team automatically? Right. Normally we reach out to them as well to ask.
Speaker3 : But again, if you reach out to Schwab and they just go ahead and send it over, that's fine too. So I can't see what it is and why it was. But they can always send it over to us. We already know that we are expecting an incoming transfer, so there would be no additional. Paperwork needed
Speaker4 : Yeah, and they should know that they should have in their system that something was that the transfer was requested, right? I wonder why they told Jim that they didn't get anything. Well, it depends, because the same with me. So if you send something into a general email box, then I may be able to see it. If you send it directly to the processing team and I'm not on that team, they may not see it yet. So sometimes with us it could take like a business day for stuff to be scanned in or you know, scanned into the account once it's received. So that may just be a delay that they don't see it yet because it says it was sent like Friday. That's the only thing I can think of, but why I don't know.
Speaker2 : So we'll just give it a couple days. We'll see what happens. Okay. All right, thank you, Monique. Thank you, Jennifer. You're very welcome. You guys have a great day.

Speaker2 : Hi, I'm trying to put in a request. To withdraw from my Ira account that I have with you guys from my old job that I had. I'm just trying to see how much because I'm reading I'm reading something like because I have like. Almost 500 in it. So I'm trying to draw all that, but I feel like I read on said like I could redraw like $0.02 or something like that. So I'm trying to figure out exactly how much I'm taking out.
Speaker3 : Okay, let's bring up that account and see what's going on with the funds in your account. Can I get your 1st and last name, please?
Speaker2 : Terrence, T E R R A N C E. And in chorus, Q U A R L E S.
Speaker3 : Thank you, Mr.. Quarles. What's a good phone number for you?
Speaker2 : 645-971-7400
Speaker3 : That was 400.
Speaker2 : Yeah, 7400.
Speaker1 : Thank you. And what is your date of birth, please?
Speaker2 : January 6, 1997.
Speaker3 : The last four numbers of your social security number.
Speaker2 : 582. 5825.
Speaker3 : And what is your address, please?
Speaker2 : 09:20 Algonquin Court.
Speaker3 : What's the city, state and zip code as well?
Speaker2 : Antioch, tennessee, 37013.
Speaker3 : Perfect. And last question, the name of the employer or the plan provider that rolled the funds over to Inspire.
Speaker2 : Hd supply
Speaker3 : Thank you for verifying that information for me, Mr.. Quarles, I did locate your traditional Ira account and it looks like by the state of your holdings that most of your funds are being held in a stable value fund and there is $0.02 available in cash. But if you stayed on that same distribution screen and scroll down a bit, it would give you the full total of what's available in your account.
Speaker1 : Which is $495.74.
Speaker2 : Okay, so how do I withdraw the 495?
Speaker3 : So are you currently still signed into your account? Okay, try refreshing the screen or just like tapping on to somewhere on there just to make sure because sometimes it does sign out after an activity. I just want to make sure that hasn't happened yet.
Speaker2 : Okay.
Speaker1 : Yeah, no problem, sir.
Speaker2 : Okay, yeah, I'm in it.
Speaker1 : Perfect. Okay, so if you.
Speaker3 : Are you viewing your account balance there or are you on the distribution screen already?
Speaker2 : I'm view on the account balance.
Speaker3 : Okay, so on the top left hand corner, you're going to open up your menu options. And you're going to select where it says.
Speaker1 : Withdraw funds
Speaker2 : Okay.
Speaker3 : Now then you'll select where it says withdraw your money, the 3rd option, I believe.
Speaker1 : And then
Speaker3 : Does it ask you to get started or is it saying continue with the?
Speaker2 : I see.
Speaker1 : Okay.
Speaker2 : Next Okay. It also says online note eligibility.
Speaker3 : Perfect. So you're going to select no.
Speaker4 : Yep.
Speaker2 : Okay. Information to hit next. Where It says your distribution request cannot be processed online. Please contact the client service specialist. So I already put one in. So Yeah, so I was assuming that it would. Let's see what I'm reading. It says something like $0.02.
Speaker3 : All right, bear with me here. just a 2nd. Let me bring up that one that you did. Just submit. All right, bear with me. It's loading for me now so I can view and just make sure that it is going to be for the full amount in your account.
Speaker4 : Okay.
Speaker3 : Okay, so you did elect for it to be a total distribution and it is going to be the $0.02 that was available for cash plus the 432.39 shares, which has a value of $495.66. So the total distribution of your account is going to be for $495.68. And then there is the closing fee, which would be $25 deducted from your account. So it is going to be.
Speaker1 : In your account. I was just letting you know that. What was already available in cash and the other money that you had, it was available in shares of that fund. But what will happen is we'll liquidate those shares for you and then send you the cash equivalent.
Speaker2 : Okay, yeah, that's okay. Yeah, let's do it. It sugar. so. As far as I know. So is there any like. Any more documentation I need to upload anything like that.
Speaker1 : As far as that one was concerned, it looks like everything was completed and they weren't requesting any additional information. So. At this point, we'll just go ahead and process your request for you within five business days, and then we'll go ahead and send those funds. How you requested next year in February is when you're going to receive the 1099 R, and that's what you'll use to file with your taxes to show that this distribution was taken. Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. for sure.
Speaker2 : Okay, yeah, yeah, that's all good.
Speaker3 : Do you have any other questions? So I say it takes up to five days. Yeah, it's up to five business days for us to process that request and then we go ahead and send you the funds direct deposit.
Speaker2 : Okay, I got you. I got you. So I did request a check. So. Yeah, because for some reason. Because I had two bank accounts that I was trying to use to. Oh, that's another question I had too. Is there any possible way I can switch it to direct deposit instead of a change?
Speaker4 : Which other bank account was it that you were trying to use? So one was a Paypal business debit account and then one was like a random like credit carbon one. I just had.
Speaker1 : Okay, so neither one of those are going to be acceptable as a form of direct deposit for us because. Yeah, it does have to be to an actual bank, like a Chase, a Wells Fargo or something like that. Bank of America. Yeah, that would work as well. And the account has to be in your name. So if that's not an option, then check a prepaid card would be your next option.
Speaker4 : Okay, yeah, yeah, that's fine. So yes, after five days. So I could probably, because if I did it yesterday, so that means probably maybe by this Friday it should at least be approved, I guess, or whatever in a couple of days after that received the check.
Speaker3 : Well, if you did it yesterday, then it would more than likely be.
Speaker1 : Monday of next week because five business days it doesn't count the weekends so right.
Speaker4 : Yeah.
Speaker1 : We already had your identity all verified and stuff. It was just a process, the actual request of moving the funds. So. It may even go through before that, but it just could take up to the five business days.
Speaker2 : Okay, okay, I got you. Okay. Yeah. So, um, yeah, I guess it's really all I had there.
Speaker3 : Okay, well if you have any other questions or if you want to check on the status again, please feel free to give us a call. Thank you for calling Inspire Financial and you have a great rest of the day. Mr.. Quarles, I as well. Thank you too. Thank you.

Speaker2 : Okay, so you see something that's pending on your side.
Speaker1 : I don't see the word pending under account asset holdings. It shows three categories with numbers. I don't see anything that says pending.

Speaker2 : I'm looking at the three holdings where you told me you were looking. Two holdings
Speaker1 : But it doesn't mat up with my cash available.
Speaker2 : Right. It won't. it won't. Your holdings are separated from the cash in your account. So anytime you get any income. Anytime you get any income coming in, a deposit coming in, or any bill pays or disbursements going out, it's going to be reflected in that cash balance.
Speaker1 : Okay. Some of these funds that are supposed to come in are from a loan, a cash, a cash out loan. That money should be showing in my cash available. Otherwise, I don't see it. It's not showing in my cash available.
Speaker2 : For which asset and how much was it for? There's only one asset in my account.
Speaker1 : Do you see the numbers there? That's what I'm saying. Are we looking at the same thing? I understand that. 293, 370, 99. That's supposed to be the value of the property. Then it shows the loan. I did 79500. It shows cash undirected funds, 3000. I mean.
Speaker2 : Where it says lender and then there's another one below that. Correct. For one campus
Speaker1 : And none of those, none of those funds are showing in my cash available.
Speaker2 : Right, but you can tell me which. When did you receive it?
Speaker1 : I don't know. I don't know. that's what I'm calling to find out. What's going on there with it, why it's not showing in my cash available. That's why I'm calling you. I don't know what to look for if you don't know what it is. So if you can tell me who sent the money, when the money was spent, we can look for it. You're not looking at the same thing I am. It shows the lender and the lender's name right next to it.
Speaker2 : That doesn't mean that the money came directly from them. Do you know how the money was sent and when it was sent?
Speaker1 : I don't know when it was sent, how they sent it. I just know the attorney sent it. shows lender 1st Western. The other one shows undirected funds. That's what I'm looking at on your website. Okay. It's amazing. I can't get it on here and no one else can tell me what's going on.
Speaker2 : So If you can find out who, I know you just said who sent the money, but when the money was sent and how it was sent, we can do research. If we don't have it posted to your account. Then that means that we don't have it. So without knowing an amount, it would be impossible for us to find it.
Speaker1 : The amounts are sitting there. That's why I ask, are you looking at account asset holdings? It's showing the amounts.
Speaker2 : The amount that was paid off or the amount that they sent over.
Speaker1 : Wow. Are you looking at the asset holdings?
Speaker2 : Yes, sir.
Speaker1 : There
Speaker2 : Associated with the asset
Speaker1 : 79000 503000 2782.
Speaker2 : Yes, you're saying that there's money, there was money sent to you that does not reflect in your cash balance. That's what you're saying.
Speaker1 : Exactly.
Speaker2 : What money and when was it spent? That's what we need to know.
Speaker1 : You just told me you see the amount 79000 503000 2782.
Speaker2 : The holding has nothing to do with the holding value, meaning the fair market value or the loan amount.
Speaker1 : I'm not talking about the fair market value. I'm not talking about the fair market value. I understand that number. There's three line items on the asset holdings. That's why I ask, are we looking at the same thing?
Speaker2 : We are
Speaker1 : Okay, there's three numbers there. It's real simple. The two bottom numbers, why are they not showing in my cash available? It's real simple.
Speaker2 : Okay, so I believe that back when you were Quest client, correct?
Speaker1 : Yes.
Speaker2 : Kept all of everything to do with your asset together with the cash. Now it's separated. Any money coming in or out is reflected in the cash. So. If you're saying that you think that that value. 79500 and $284, 9013 should be reflected in your cash. It's not, because it's not cash. If the loan was completely paid off. Meaning they sent a, let me explain that we're going around and around and you're still not getting it. Let me explain it one more time. There was no loan on it.
Speaker1 : There was no loan. You keep saying loan. There was no loan. I did a cash out. Now I have a loan, but the cash I did out is supposed to go in the account. There was no existing loan prior to that.
Speaker2 : Okay, so me look at the lender is right there on the page 1st western. I can see that and it says that it was on 07:24. Let me take a look. Okay, so right, so my question is, when does that money show in my cash available? I have no access it until it goes into cash available.
Speaker1 : It's just sitting in some line item. I have no access to it yet.
Speaker2 : Right. So we only, in the deposits department, we only handle incoming money. So that's the reason why I don't have an answer. So if it's transaction based and you're looking for a transaction, I can help you with that. If it has to do with the loan, I need to get you to the department that handles the specific loan. I do not know what what's going on with the loan? I keep getting transferred around. Nobody knows anything. Wow.
Speaker1 : This is a nightmare. Dealing with inspiring. It's a nightmare. Yeah. Unfortunately, I don't have all the knowledge when it comes to loan documents and transactions, but I do see where it is. So did they transfer me to you on the 24th? I don't know, sir. So why'd they transfer me to you then? I don't know, sir. I apologize. That's what I'm telling you. That's part of the flaws with this company. They move you around to people who don't know what they're talking about with what I need. Yeah.
Speaker2 : I'll give them the feedback as well. but let me, let me just put you on a brief hold and make sure I can get you over to the right department. Okay, I'll be right back.",RW_20250729180139679169523057VOICE00653e91b62d425dbd8c57a3d8d10b1f,account status inquiry,Account status inquiry refers to a request for information about the current state of an account.,Transferred to the correct department.,36,Account Status Inquiry,"The intent 'Account Status Inquiry' is used consistently across all input statements to refer to checking the current status, details, or balance of an account.

Speaker2 : Sure.
Speaker1 : Mr.. Williams. Yes, sir. Thank you. I had to double check with the processor on this. So I did see the notes that it did actually take a couple of days to actually liquidate the funds. So we need to liquidate the account 1st into cash before we can process the request. So it just showing the notes that the liquidation was completed today. And so from this point on then. The rest will be processed as a check and mailed out to you.
Speaker2 : Okay. Do you believe that I, that that will be mailed out and I should receive it?
Speaker1 : I can't guarantee the time frame, but I would say sometime this week should be mailed out. It's sent regular mail, so I can't guarantee from that point how long it will take once we mail it out in the mail there.
Speaker2 : Is it possible for me to be able to change it, to have it? Deposited directly into my bank account. I know. It's late now, but I'm like kind of nervous about it getting here. I just want to make sure I get it.
Speaker1 : Okay, let me check with her here.
Speaker2 : If it's too late, it's too late. I just figured I'd ask.
Speaker1 : Right. Because I'm not sure if you have to complete that form again to. Add that information. So let me just check with them. Do you have avoided check?
Speaker2 : Yeah, yes I do. I got my check here. Okay, let me just double check with him here. Okay.
Speaker1 : 2nd term She's asking, are you able to email that way to check now?
Speaker2 : Do you need the actual check or do you just need the numbers?
Speaker1 : The actual a copy of the check.
Speaker2 : Okay. If there's a bit of a complication. I haven't re upped my other checks and the bank changed from Tcf to Huntington, same location on Lake Street, 3118 East Lake Street, but it's. Although the check says Tcf Bank, it actually goes to Huntington Bank. I don't know if that's going to be a big, too big of a complication for you or not.
Speaker1 : Yeah, you can just submit it and see what it should be. Fine, but. We'll just, because we have to use this fraud prevention program, kind of helps us verify if we can process as direct deposit or not. So. What's your email address?
Speaker2 : My email address is F Jj. Williams, W I L L I A M as in Mary, S as in Sam, I I I As in the 3rd At gmail.com
Speaker1 : So I sent you that email. You can just reply and attach a copy of that voided check there.
Speaker2 : Okay. And it's okay for me to take a picture of it and include it as an attachment, correct? And just take a picture.
Speaker1 : Again, I mentioned that fraud prevention program. We do have to submit that and see if we can do it or not. So we will try to do as a direct deposit. For some reason, it doesn't verify that in our system. Then we'll just send a check instead. but we'll try the direct deposit. 1st. Just be aware of that. We can try it, but if it fails, then we'll just send a check.
Speaker2 : Okay. That sounds good. All righty, I'll be glad to. I'll check the email there and I'll submit the voided check.
Speaker1 : Okay, and when do you think you'll be able to do that? I'm going to do that right now. So you should get it. You should get it within the next 1015 minutes. Okay, no problem sir. Other than that, Mr., Williams, any other questions for me today?

Speaker1 : Yes, hi. My name's Josie Spiel Bugle and I received a letter. Last week from Tia that what's left in my University of Pittsburgh retirement account is going to be transferred to your bank, but I would prefer that money to go to my Edward Jones account. And I have my account number and their address and phone number. To move out, please let me take a look at your account. What's your 1st and last name? Josephine J O S E P H I N E. Last name Spiel Bogle, S as in Sam, P as in Paul, I E. L As in Victor O G E L
Speaker2 : Okay, so Spiel Vogel. I E L O G E L
Speaker1 : Yes.
Speaker2 : Would you be under any other last name in our system other than that last name?
Speaker1 : I'm sorry.
Speaker2 : Would you be under any other last name in our system other than the name you just gave me? No.
Speaker1 : No.
Speaker2 : Because I don't see you in our system. So your 1st name is Josephine. That's J O S E P H I N. Would that be correct?
Speaker1 : Yes.
Speaker2 : Okay. I don't see you in our system. If you like, I can. Look you up by your Social Security number if you like. Okay, sure.
Speaker1 : Social Security number is 184. Five, four. 0232.
Speaker2 : That's 184-54-0232.
Speaker1 : Yes. Yes.
Speaker2 : I don't think
Speaker1 : I don't think they'd have it under my married name. I think it came as Josephine Spiel Vogel. The letter.
Speaker2 : Yeah, I don't see in our system. So When did this count roll over to us?
Speaker1 : It didn't They sent me a letter and asked me. If I didn't respond in so many days, they would, they would open a new account at a bank. I believe it was in Indiana. So I sent a letter to my E. Jones representative and told him I would like. They're going to roll it into a Roth Ira. But I have all my retirement money with Edward Jones.
Speaker2 : Right. But my question is, how are, were you notified that the funds came to us? Did your employer send you a letter saying they already rolled over the funds to us? and if so, when was that date that they rolled over? I don't see any
Speaker1 : Yeah, it must have come from the University of Pittsburgh and said it would go through your. How
Speaker2 : When did this happen? How'd they notify you of this?
Speaker1 : Just last week.
Speaker2 : I'm sorry, you faded out on me. What was that again? Oh, I'm sorry. I received a letter.
Speaker1 : And They said it was rolled into this system. so.
Speaker2 : When would it be rolled over to us? What does the letter state? Because we don't have the funds here. We don't have the count here.
Speaker1 : Okay, yeah, the letter stated it would be rolled over in seven days and letter was dated.
Speaker2 : Okay. What date?
Speaker1 : To citizens are not citizens Can't remember the name of the bank I sent the letter. I forwarded it to Jones. And He called back, he gave me my account number up there for them to send the information.
Speaker2 : Here's the thing. We don't have the account, we don't have the money.
Speaker1 : Oh, so they didn't pull it over yet.
Speaker2 : Right. That's what I'm trying to figure out because. You said there's a date that they were seven days from the date, but you could tell me the date of the letter. It was this a long time ago. Was it something recent that did you got the letter from them? Yeah.
Speaker1 : I received a letter last week. And The date on the letter was like July 13 or something. It was earlier in the month.
Speaker2 : Okay, so then if it's seven days from the day that letter they're going to roll over, the public to hasn't had a chance to be open with us yet. So it's not open with us yet. There's not much we can do. So you'd have to wait for the count to get open. So call us maybe later on this week or next week. Hopefully the column will be open. Once it is, then we can give you transfer instruction, outgoing transfer instructions, and what we're going to need to process the transfer to Edward Jones. Okay, okay. I didn't know if they.
Speaker1 : They probably already rolled that over.
Speaker2 : Here's what happens. They'll usually send us the money 1st and maybe a couple weeks later they'll send us your personal data file, which is the file that we need with your personal information on to open up your account, to have your. SE your name, everything. So we need the money and we need the data file. Sometimes, you know, one comes 1st and the and the other one comes a little bit later so the count's not open yet but it's not unusual for this to happen. So I would say just give us a call probably next week sometime hopefully will be open by that time. Once it is open, then we can give you instructions on how to take control of your account with us, register with us, register your account with us and how and then we'll give you your outgoing transfer instructions, I think to Edward Jones to have them. Send us their transfer request, but we'll give you all those instructions once you. Once you, once the accounts actually open, I would say make sure that you know from your investment advisor what type of an account you have with them there so that we give you the instructions to transfer your account to Edward Jones. We're giving you the correct instructions, right? You know what's happening, what's on there? Yeah, I was surprised when I got the letter. It said seven days. I'm like, my, gee, it's already like late.
Speaker1 : So I thought they did it like automatically, but no, I will call back in a week or two.
Speaker2 : Yeah, it's not an instantaneous thing and unfortunately it takes a little time. It's not only your funds coming over, but it's usually a group of people from that plan coming over to us.
Speaker1 : Okay, so it's a lot of information. We usually get a lump sum of all the money we have to distribute between all the accounts. We have to get the, you know, we have to get the data files for all the participants of the plan and then set up all the grants at one time and then distribute the funds into it. So it does take a little time, so it's not unusual. So, yeah, no. well, you know, like I said, I was surprised when they said, you have seven days to let us know what we want to do with this. But thank you kindly. I understand.
Speaker2 : Okay, okay. Yeah, you might want to get a copy that letter from your, if you call back, you might, before you do call back the next time you might want to get to see if you get a copy of that letter that you gave to your investment advisor. See if we can send you a copy this way when you call us, you'll have the details in front of you if we have any questions to what was sent to us. Okay.

On the website, you can see the investment options in case you want to invest or add more money to the account. The 2nd option is transfer the money to another Ira, like another custodian. You can also roll over the money to another employer, like another company. Or the last option will be just withdraw the funds to your personal bank account. Keep in mind if you decided to withdraw the funds, taxes and penalties may apply by the Irs as well. If you take out all the funds, this account will be closed. There is a closing fee of $25, and you will receive a 1099 R form. It's a tax form on January 2026 the next year to fill up the taxes. With that information said Have you maybe decided what to do with the phones or maybe you want to think about it?

Speaker2 : Hi SE, this is Carol and Donna Phelps, A. Jones' office. And I have a question about a transfer that we submitted to you for account number 7712582 for David Holcomb.
Speaker1 : Okay. What's your question?
Speaker2 : Okay, so David told me that he got an email from you that said that you needed a corporate resolution on this transfer.
Speaker3 : And so I was so just a 2nd ago I talked to your David there at Inspired and he said, well, you know, it can be either a corporate resolution or. A Medallion stamp. Okay.
Speaker2 : So, okay, so. My question is, so I was working on trying to get the corporate resolution, but I found out from my back office, they said, well.
Speaker3 : It'd be easier to do the medallion stamp.
Speaker2 : And here's my question. Do you accept a fax copy of the medallion stamp or do you have to have the wet signature?
Speaker3 : All right, let me find out for you. Time Go
Speaker1 : All right, I sent that question out to account services. If they don't get back to me quick, I'll just call them.
Speaker2 : Okay, well, while we're waiting on that, I got a couple more questions. So my transfer department was telling me they said, well, did they? I guess we have some kind of notations based on, I guess, previous transfers that have been done from you that.
Speaker3 : I guess I want to know if there's anything else wrong with this transfer because she said sometimes y'all will reject because the full Social Security number is not on the transfer form. Do you require, I mean, we just usually put the last four digits, which is what's on that paperwork that we submitted. Does that work for you or do you need? The whole social security number.
Speaker1 : All right.
Speaker3 : And then I have one more question. She also said that a lot of times that y'all request a copy of their driver's license. Do you request, do you require that?
Speaker2 : This was just notes, I guess, from.
Speaker3 : You know. Experience
Speaker2 : And in those notes, it also said you don't require a medallion stamp for anything other than $250000, which is not correct either, apparently because you're requesting it on this one.
Speaker3 : So I'm just wanting to check and see so that we don't, you know, have to get it back again.
Speaker2 : All we're requesting is the cash that's in the account. He's got some kind of a partnership.
Speaker3 : Or something like that in there. So we're just asking for the cash that recently got added into the account. Okay. And it's like a hundred and something. About 131800 6573 the last time he lived.
Speaker0 : Oh.
Speaker1 : Yeah, I might just call the department just. So I don't keep you waiting too long.
Speaker3 : Okay.
Speaker1 : All right, hold on.
Speaker3 : Thank you.
Speaker2 : This account
Speaker1 : Hi ma'am. All right, I'm back. So okay, we will accept the fax. And electronic signature if Cc is included. We will accept what's what's the Toc? Yeah, hold on. I'm going to open up this form. I don't know either. We will accept full or partial social security number depending on what the receiving custodians requires. We do not require a driver's license. Now let me open this what they sent me because it will probably say what a Cc is. Certificate of completion. Okay.
Speaker2 : What is that?
Speaker1 : If signed electronically, it's client verification of signature. I can send you. I still don't know what you mean. Okay, so wait a minute. So, okay, let's just.
Speaker2 : Can you? Okay, so. Looking. Do you have our transfer paperwork there in front of you? No, I'm just a. No, I don't work in. Oh, you don't get it. Okay. So number one. We can't do electronic signature because apparently I guess we don't have whatever the relationship is between our firm and your firm is that lets it be electronically. Signed and so we have to do this, you know. By, you know, do the paper form And then, you know, we fax it to you, which we already did. And then, you know. Our paperwork, our transfer paperwork to you. Only, and because this is the way Edward Jones' paperwork prints out, it doesn't have the full Social Security number. It redact those 1st numbers and only lists the last four. But it sounds like you're saying that that's okay because it's okay with us, right?
Speaker1 : Correct.
Speaker2 : Okay, that's what I was getting out of that. Okay. And then I'm fuzzy on this certificate of completion. Explain that to me again.
Speaker1 : What is that? Are you saying? No, you said something about certificate of completion. What about that? The Co. What about it? That is Let me get to this again. It said we will accept the fax and electronic signature if certificate of completion is included.
Speaker2 : Okay, how do we get that? What is that?
Speaker1 : Certificate of completion, client verification of signature if signed electronically, that's certificate of completion. Verbal is required if email does not match that we have.
Speaker2 : I don't know what that means. Client verification But he didn't Yeah, but. Yeah, it's not signed electronically.
Speaker1 : Okay, then you don't have to worry about that. It says if signed electronically, we need certificate of completion.
Speaker2 : You're talking about the client is signing our paperwork that he requested this. From you. Is that what you're talking about? Yeah, it's client verification of signature. Yes. Okay. So, okay, so. And you don't have to have the full Social Security number. You don't have to have a copy of the driver's license. Correct? Correct. Okay, so and just looking, I mean, are you able to see that y'all sent some kind of a rejection? And, you know, because it needed to have, I guess, either the corporate resolution or the medallion stamp.
Speaker1 : I do see that and that's all this deficient on this, right? Excuse me, what did you say?
Speaker2 : That's the only thing that's wrong with this. That's the only thing missing. The only note on this transaction is.
Speaker1 : Missing medallion stamp or corporate resolution. That is it. Okay.
Speaker2 : Okay, so all we got to do is we can just fax you over the transfer paperwork that's been medallion stamped.
Speaker1 : Correct. Do you have the fax number?
Speaker2 : Is it 321-926-1156?
Speaker1 : That's it.

Speaker2 : It came from I want to say Drucker Holdings, D R U K E R.
Speaker1 : Okay, perfect. All right, so how can I help you?
Speaker2 : All right. So I was actually not aware that this account existed. It's from a previous Job And it looks like There have been holdings in this account for a few years now. Like I see that I have a value of like $192, which is down from. Almost 400 Or like three, five, oh, back from March in 2021. I don't know if it was higher than that or goes from before that. But I would really like to stop losing money out of this and transfer this into my fidelity account. So I'm assuming that there's nothing you're able to do to. Roll back any of the transactions. Or the fees that I've been charged by holding this account since 2021. Is that right?
Speaker1 : Yeah. They probably should have let you know that.
Speaker2 : Yeah, it would have been really nice because I just lost a couple hundred bucks. Now I'm talking about your plan, whoever it is. The Drucker Company.
Speaker1 : They're supposed to send letters out letting you know that.
Speaker2 : Yeah. I just got a letter last week, the 1st one I've received since I stopped working at the company in 2020. So at this point. I know you guys charge fees, it seems like every six months or something to hold on to these accounts. No.
Speaker1 : We charge them yearly and I do see back that you've been sent like. $54.98 tax forms. I see Back in 21 and 22.
Speaker2 : Those might have gone to an old address because I'm living in Dc. So anyways. I guess what I am hoping to do. I have an Ira. Set up through my current employer. And I would like to withdraw whatever's left in here. What's the best way to go about doing that? Yeah, you can do that in your online account under withdrawal.
Speaker1 : If you want to directly roll these funds into A 401 K plan that you have now. You can do that online. Before you start, you're going to need to get a few things from your new plan. So you'll need to know who to make the check payable to. Plan name And plan number
Speaker2 : Who to make the check payable to the plan number.
Speaker1 : And the plan
Speaker2 : Name Okay.
Speaker1 : Okay, let's see here. So that's what you're going to need to know. Let me just see something real quick. Just bear with me 1 s. Let's look at something real quick. I'll go ahead and I'm going to go ahead and credit you two of the fees. Okay?
Speaker2 : Okay, I really appreciate that. Yeah, that's at least 70 bucks, but definitely, yeah.
Speaker1 : I'll go ahead and credit you two of them. I'm able to go ahead and do that. Okay.
Speaker2 : Thank you so much.
Speaker1 : All right, you're so welcome. You're so welcome. So yeah, let me. Right now. let me see. Your account value is one 9240 fives. So when you see. When you go into your online account and you see the account value is 190 02:40 fives plus 70, that's when you should go ahead and do it. Okay, so don't don't take a direct roll over it to you see them. And it could take a couple of days. So. Yeah. The Those $270 has been credited, then go ahead and do it. So yeah, you'll go under. You'll go into withdrawal and then you pick the 1st option, direct rollover to an employer sponsored plan. And then it's pretty self explanatory. You just follow it from there.
Speaker2 : Okay, and I might need to call my current provider. Just to get a couple Extra things rolling. Yeah, but you're definitely going to need to get those three things. You're going to have to have that before you start this.
Speaker1 : Before you start this direct rollover. So I'm going to go ahead and put that credit in to give you a credit for $70 on two of those fees. I really appreciate that. Thank you. You are so welcome. You're so welcome, Mr.. Curse. Is there anything else I can assist you with?

Speaker1 : All right, 401 K. And do you remember what was the name of the previous company that have had your 401 K before us? Yes, it was. Una Health I'm working on it. Okay. All right, well. Looks like I don't see any retirement account over your name, but I can try to transfer you. Probably you are talking about another type of account, so if you let me transfer you, I will transfer you. What type of account? Okay, over this plan, we can just manage Ira accounts, like traditional and Roth Ira accounts, But as I said, it looks like you don't have any Ira. Account here with us. That's the reason I shall transfer you to your other department because it looks like you have another type of account.
Speaker2 : Okay, so there is an actual account there. I guess that's what I'm trying to find out.
Speaker1 : Okay, well. As I said, I tried to with the 1st and last of all the information that they gave me. and as I said, it looks like you don't have any retirement account here, but I mean, I'm trying to assist you and if you let me transfer you, probably the other agent will be able to find something over your name.
Speaker2 : Okay, would you be able to transfer my information so I don't have to repeat it all again?
Speaker1 : Well, I will tell to the other colleague that you already gave me your 1st date of birth.
Speaker2 : Thank you very much. If he asks you something else, well, it's. yeah, you will need to answer. All right, so please bear with me.
Speaker1 : Okay, please bear with me. I appreciate it. Thank you so much for holding online. I really apologize for all the time on hold. I was I was discussing with my colleague to the other department and it looks like she doesn't have any information either about your account. And let me ask you something, did you receive any type of welcome letter from Inspired Financial, something like that?
Speaker2 : What I received was It We're thrilled to reunite you with your retirement savings you left behind from your employer when you worked at univariate instructions on what to do with your retirement savings. Because what happened was they went bankrupt and a lot of people lost things at that particular point in time. And then. I guess apparently it was transferred. So they transferred your savings to an account. In your name. In Sara Financial And then it has That it's a 401 K and There's a Qr code to access. The account
Speaker1 : All right. That's weird. Okay, because as I said. I gave to the other colleagues all the information that you gave me. But he couldn't find any information about you. Let me see. And what is the date of that letter that you received? Pretty long ago or it's just
Speaker2 : It was from last week.
Speaker1 : All right, next week. What happens sometimes is that the processing time for rollover accounts between the. Financial accounts, financial companies, and take a couple of weeks. probably your account is still being in process to be here but at this moment. Unfortunately, we don't have any account or any retirement account over your name. I can try But I can try. Sorry, go ahead.
Speaker2 : No, no, go ahead.
Speaker1 : Okay, I was saying that I can try it as a last resource to transfer you to. To another Agent and see if he or she is able to look at something. But yeah, that's the last resource that I have.
Speaker2 : Okay, so this is this something that is this something that would normally happen then it like if someone if you call in and I mean I'm just trying to figure out if what I'm looking at is Is there actually an account there? Like, I wouldn't have just received this for no reason, right?
Speaker1 : Right. as I said, sometimes happens that the client received a letter, but. The account can take a while, can take a couple, a considerable time to being set up here and to be created here probably. Okay, so is that why the Qr code didn't work? Yeah, that's probably the reason anyway. If you have an account here and if your account was transferred here, you're supposed to have or to receive a welcoming kit. Being mailed to your home, but it Should say something like welcome to inspire of we are now your custodian of your retirement account. Something like that I should say.
Speaker2 : Yeah, this just says we're thrilled to. Reunite you with your retirement savings. Okay, so I mean I can try this. Should I just wait and try this again like in a couple of weeks and see?
Speaker1 : Yeah, I should recommend that. as I said, there are some that can take a couple of weeks to be instead of in our records. But yes, you should call us. You should keep in touch with us. You can try to call us next week in order to see if we have something.
Speaker2 : Okay, I'll do that. All right, thank you very much. By the way, you've been really helpful.

Speaker1 : Yesterday I was trying to get in it with some assistance from. From another agent but I had run out of time because I was doing it during my lunch and I had to get back to work and. The next time that I had called was around five ish and I hadn't seen that you guys close around seven. Central time, which would be five for me. So that's why I didn't get to finish it yesterday.
Speaker2 : Okay, are you able to check your email?
Speaker1 : Yes.
Speaker2 : Perfect. Please go there and see the last email that it was sent by my partner.
Speaker1 : Would you want me to open the link? Is that what?

Okay, That means that once you click on it, you have to complete it because if you close it, it's not going to let you open it again. And the only thing that you have to do is fill out all the information that is going to ask you. Okay, once you complete that form is going to have a time frame to be under review of maximum three business days. And after that, we are going to send you a confirmation email with instructions to access the account.

Speaker2 : A picture of an Id. Like an expired drivers license, a passport, or a state Id.
Speaker1 : Like with the form
Speaker2 : Yeah, the form is going to ask you to upload a picture. Okay, it's just that since this account was opened on your behalf and well, we don't have like the documentation and the information updated that usually the companies. Ask before opening an account. So yeah, it's like an account agreement so you can provide us with that information.
Speaker1 : Because That's one thing I don't have on me right now.
Speaker2 : So sometimes it's requested, sometimes no, but it's better if you have the Id with you right now. Okay. And also Well, I think that that form have an option that says I'll do it later. So you can just click on that option and you can send it by email. Okay, But we are going to start the process in the moment that we receive that document. But you got my mail.
Speaker1 : Excuse me.

Speaker1 : Right.
Speaker0 : Okay.
Speaker3 : Okay, I had a question. So I'm on a question that says account details and it just says to select an account type.
Speaker4 : Yeah, your account type is a traditional Ira.
Speaker3 : Okay, traditional. It wouldn't be the Roth one, right? The post text.
Speaker4 : Correct. So your account is pre tax. That means that once you withdraw the money, you have to pay the taxes on this amount.
Speaker3 : Once I withdraw the money.
Speaker2 : Yes.
Speaker4 : So do you already know what you are going to do with this money?
Speaker3 : Well, It was more so that I wanted to have an access to the account because I haven't had it before. And I had saw that there was a bit of money that was in there. I wanted to take some of it out. Yes, but not all of it necessarily.
Speaker4 : Okay, yeah, you can do that. Okay, so let's just complete this form and then I'm going to provide you with the options that you have. Okay.
Speaker3 : Okay.
Speaker0 : Yes. Yes.
Speaker4 : Okay, any question at the moment?
Speaker3 : No, I had gone to the one that you were talking about, the one with, um, taking a picture. Of um It says name verification. Identification number And then birth date of birth verification.
Speaker4 : Yeah. Yeah, the only thing that you have to upload is like an Id document that has all that information. If you have your driver license, that is going to be enough. Also, as I said before, it's not necessary that you do it right now. You can just click on, I'll do it later. And when you have the documents, you can send it via email.
Speaker3 : Okay. Like to the same address like the one you sent me something on.
Speaker4 : Yep, actually you can just reply to that email address and attach the document. Okay, you are going to know that you did it correctly because in about three to 5 min after you fill out, after you send us the document, you are going to receive a confirmation email. Informing you that we received it and that we are going to work on it. Okay.
Speaker3 : Okay.
Speaker4 : Okay, so once you complete that form, it should be showing you a tracking code, correct?

And It was requested That We provide a signed copy. Of the investment It was requested from what I understood it was requested from you guys, but you know that I'm just, I'm just giving you information that I was told that I had to provide. This Signed promissory, the signed investment to you guys in order For the distribution check to be
Speaker1 : To be deposited
Speaker2 : Yeah, which was weird. I mean.
Speaker1 : That's kind of odd. Okay, let me look at me. It's for Mr., Stryker, right?
Speaker2 : Right, but he's paying me because this is my my. Promissory note with him And he's paying me my quarterly distribution. Does that make any sense at all? I lent him the money.
Speaker1 : Yes, yes, yes. So he's paying your Ira back. Quarterly distribution. That is correct. Okay, let me see if I can find the note. It was the note for $50000.
Speaker2 : Yes.
Speaker1 : Okay.
Speaker0 : All right, well, it's not in there.
Speaker1 : Let me see if I can.
Speaker0 : Let me define it.
Speaker1 : Was it the unsecured note or was it a secured note?
Speaker2 : I think, let me see here, let me see, I think it's right here. It is I hate to ask. I hate to be stupid. How do I? It's the unsecured one. It's the unsecured. Okay, let me see if I can find it.
Speaker1 : Let me go back in your attachments.
Speaker0 : That's not it. That's not. Give me 2 s. 9625. Yeah, but it's not in here.
Speaker1 : And we did this back when we were at Quest. So. Let me see, are just coming over to inspire us. Yeah, because it was done in December, December last year. 24. Yeah. Oh, I wonder if this is it.
Speaker0 : No, this is This is Mr.. Striker.
Speaker1 : Assignment of interest Let me look at this one. Okay. Well, it doesn't look like we even have a copy of the note. Because if it hasn't been closed out, it was supposed to be moved over from Quest and. There is no way I can go back onto the sales force in quest to pull those because that sales force is non existent any longer. Any unsecured notes or any. Notes or documents that we had in our vault that got moved over to Inspire are getting ready to be mailed out to the clients. Do you have a copy of it?
Speaker2 : Yeah. I do
Speaker1 : Wonderful Can you send it over to the SDA email? And Go ahead.
Speaker2 : I was going to say that's why I was palling. I didn't know who I needed to send it to. So I'll send it to the ST. I'll just type that in and that. But what attention does it go to?
Speaker1 : You could put Timothy or you could put my name in the subject line. All we're going to do is pull it since we've already funded and everything and we just don't have a copy or I would have sent it to you. So what's going to happen is once we get it, one of us will send it back over to you through Docusign, really quick for you to sign, read, and approved because we don't even have a copy of that. And when we get that, then we can go ahead and initiate it and sign it. There should be a place in the document itself for Our signature And it could be in quest Name since we're not modifying it, you're just getting a payoff. We just need to sign it so it could come as is. And then there should be a place where it says Quest Trust Company, Fbo. Natalie Nest Ira and then we'll sign underneath there. Okay, and then get that set. Get that sent back over to you.
Speaker2 : I'm not following you on all of it, but I do know that I will send it to you. I'm just getting into my computer right now. And I will get it. I will get it attached and send over. Let me see, where did I put it? I downloaded, let's see. I did them earlier so I will find them and then and I'll just, you know, I'll just send you whatever I have. I had a couple different. A couple different things that I printed and will send. So I'll just send you all of it and just use what you use what you need and trash what you don't need. So absolutely, yes ma'am. And then we'll save it up in your file just in case we ever needed to get to it again. Yeah, yeah, because that was another question. He's going to pay these out quarterly. So is this going to be something you guys need each quarter or is it just you don't have it right now? So now you need this for the initial.
Speaker1 : I don't understand. I don't know. We really don't. I mean, we have. Let look in your holdings because we have it still open. The unsecured. No, I don't know why. Somebody would need Executed document why we would, I mean he might need it because he didn't ever get one from us signing the unsecured note but As far as us, we wouldn't need that to apply the payment to your unsecured to your to your note. But it's good for us to.
Speaker2 : Because he didn't have it.
Speaker1 : Right. If he doesn't have it, yes, ma'am. If he doesn't have it, usually normally on unsecured notes. The borrower and the lender would like us to sign on it because it is an unsecured note. There's nothing securing it. So our signature just tells the borrower, hey, we've accepted it, we've processed it, we fund it, and we're holding it. But since he doesn't have it, maybe that's what he's looking for.
Speaker2 : Okay, and I don't even think it was him. I think because. Because when Shannon, his right hand person, when she was doing all of this, she sent me the text and said, hey. Because of the size of this of yours. Because it's a larger payment and a larger investment. They need to have the signed. Information So
Speaker1 : Okay, all we could do that, no worries. Just send it over. We'll look at it. Make sure that we have everything on there and then we'll send it over to you for your RD and approved signature really quick. And then once we get that back, then we'll submit it over for inspire signers to sign it. And then They sign it, we'll just email it back over to you so you can send it on over to Mr., Stryker or we could try to find his email and send it to him too. So.
Speaker2 : Okay, yeah, yeah, whatever needs to be done, I'm going to send these. Here you go is what I'm saying. And I'm right now. Literally there are like four of them on there and don't worry about what I. Named them. It was just because I do need to also go through this investment. When we 1st made it out. It was for something called Au and that's why it says ad on it. Well. We really, it ended up being a Ppr investment. so. I need to go through probably, I don't know if I need to go through a name change on it or how I need to do that or what I need to do to make it. Legit, shall we say? That it is Ppr, not Ad.
Speaker1 : Let us look at it because we don't have any other documents to compare it to. We still consider it an unsecured note because there is no security to it. But if you would like us to change it from Ross, because right now it's under U. S. T. R. 50 K but once we get it, if it's supposed to be a different name, we can always do an asset. Exchange name and we could just Take out the U ST R 50 K and we can enter in. The The new name that you would like it to be.
Speaker2 : Okay, yeah, I probably do want to do that, but let's. Let's Let's, I sent that to you and I just said, attention, Timothy or Robin. So. Let's go through what you're needing to do with that and then let's go through with the name change thing. And if you can just email me kind of like instructions on what we need to do because. I'm not multitasking very well.
Speaker1 : No worries, no worries. I will get with him as soon as we get it in, I will get with him or I'll grab it. If we need some help, I'm always here. And then we'll just get it done really quick. It might not be today, might be in the morning, but we will be.
Speaker2 : Perfect. sounds perfect.
Speaker1 : Wonderful. Well, if you need anything else, you know, you feel free to just give us a call. Once we get that taken care of, then we'll email you over some instructions on how, you know, on exactly what we need to do to get it changed and we'll just confirm how you want it to read.

Speaker1 : Yes, it's Jj. Jj. Powell, P O W E L L. Or At gmail.com and I have the instructions from your website, but it didn't make sense to me.
Speaker2 : It's okay, I can explain it. So to do a transfer, you basically just need to call your new provider, like your new Ira, and they will need to send us the request, like the transfer paperwork. Usually they know what to do.
Speaker1 : They told me to call you. And I'm on their website and it says what to do and it says to call my old provider. And it said that you might need a letter of acceptance.
Speaker2 : Right from the other Ira. Like if you have the information, you can send the information to us. But usually the Ira is the one who has that letter of a sentence or delivery instructions, all that information. Because here at Epa, we don't have like an actual paperwork. We just received the transfer paperwork from the other Ira.
Speaker1 : Okay. I can create that form with you on the call. I can create a letter of acceptance, but I have to do it with you.
Speaker2 : But the letter Of a sentence Needs to have the Signature of the other Ira That's the reason why, I mean, if you want to, the best option would be call them and ask them to send that information to us. They usually is the one who have that information. As well
Speaker1 : This is exactly what my employer said to move my old 401 K or Ira to a fidelity. Ira will start with the provider of your old workplace plan. You can call your former employer and you will start your rollover by calling the provider and using their website. You, as in Inspire, may require forms like a letter of acceptance from Fidelity. Or you'll use your own paperwork signed by me or fidelity. When speaking to the old provider, I've got some questions to ask. Yeah, and then you can send forms to. I have an address for you to send the forms to.
Speaker2 : Okay, I understand. But not the thing is we don't send the transfer paperwork, we just receive. Those forms here in his. We don't have an actual transfer paper or like a former we don't have. If fidelity is also not, then my money is just locked in with you guys. You see what I'm saying? I don't know how to.
Speaker1 : Because I called them already and then they gave me this page and then they call you and then I have a place for you to send forms. What I can do is call fidelity and put us all free on the phone. But I can't just leave the money with you. Okay, so can you hold on? Pause and I'll pull them on.
Speaker2 : Yes, no further
Speaker1 : Thank you. Hey there, I'm still trying to get a hold of him.
Speaker2 : Are you still there? That's fine. I'm gonna try again. One moment. Sir, are you there? Hello, can you hear me?

Speaker2 : Yes.
Speaker1 : All right, so I was able to locate the account. I can see that you do have a rollover traditional Ira. Now in regards to the options, there are four. 1st You can cash out the money, but since the funds will go to you personally and not to another retirement account, so higher taxes and penalties may apply. And also there will be a 1099 R form that will be mailed to you. 2nd option. If you do have like a different Ira custodian, you can transfer this account to them. 3rd option, you can roll over this to your current employer. The last option is to keep your account with us, but with an annual fee of $30.
Speaker2 : Okay. Do you know how much the fees would be if I was to take the money out?
Speaker1 : If you want to do a distribution towards yourself.
Speaker2 : Right.
Speaker1 : Let me check for We don't know how much they will charge you, however, for the penalty. that's for early withdrawal. That is about 10 %. And also you will be charged for the closing fee. It's $25.
Speaker2 : Okay, so either way there's going to be a fee of $25 if I'm not keeping an account with y'all. So for like three of the four options, I'm gonna be charged that fee.
Speaker1 : That's correct.
Speaker2 : Okay.
Speaker1 : By the way, Sorry, sorry, go ahead.
Speaker2 : No, you're fine. You can go ahead.
Speaker1 : Yeah, do you have access? I mean, do you still have access? Online. So I can watch
Speaker2 : Because I only see options to do to like switch it over to another account. I don't see an option for me to take it out and. Send it to myself.
Speaker1 : Actually On the menu You just need to look for withdraw funds option and once you will click that. There are three things pop out. Like let me check. Roll over to your current employer, transfer to a different Ira, and the 3rd option is to withdraw your money. That means do a distribution towards yourself.
Speaker2 : I'm logging in now to see. The Incorrect. I just logged in.

Speaker1 : Oh yeah, you'll be 60 in November. Yeah, you shouldn't. You're already past the. Eight 09:10. Yeah, you're 59 and a half.
Speaker2 : Does that mean that Do I have to pay tax on this money at any point?
Speaker1 : Well, it's considered earned income, so it will be subjected to taxes. You just won't be penalized because you're already 59 and a half. So it's two separate things.
Speaker2 : How much taxes will be
Speaker1 : You have to
Speaker2 : Or something.
Speaker1 : Yeah, we give you a 1099 that you'll file on your taxes and then it'll tell you if any taxes are owed. That's what I was trying to figure out. Okay?

Speaker2 : Do you know what kind of account do you have with your bank?
Speaker1 : So I guess that's my next question. If you guys have a specific requirement for an account, I called my bank and they said that to their knowledge, it could be transferred to a savings account with no problems.
Speaker2 : What do you mean by transfer? Do you want to cash out the money?
Speaker1 : Potentially, ma'am. I guess that's what I'm trying to find out today.
Speaker2 : Because we have different process. You can cash out the money, transfer the money into another Ira, or roll over the account. So I need to know if you want to draw 1st cash out. Yeah, I'm sorry. Tell me. I would imagine cash out would be transferring, I guess me withdrawing that money and transferring it to my bank.
Speaker1 : Is that correct?
Speaker2 : Cash out the money is that you want to be the person that received the money. DR. is if you want us to send the money to another custodian because you have a different account, a different Ira.
Speaker1 : No, ma'am, if that account, account with my bank wouldn't be an Ra. So yeah, what would be more information regarding cashing out?
Speaker2 : Okay, so if you want to cash out the money, you must claim this account 1st and request the money online. So please provide your email to me.
Speaker1 : Yeah. Is there any fees, ma'am, for this?

Speaker2 : Okay, what last name have you placed on the form?
Speaker1 : I'm not sure if I can go back, but I put both last names, Beretta, German. If I made a mistake doing that, I know it can get a little confusing. Both last names.
Speaker2 : You don't have to go back and this form is for the update information. So you must include the information you want us to have on record. So now you must send the required documentation.
Speaker1 : Okay, a question ma'am, because I don't know my employer can make things up as well as my employer. Did he write down as just my Beretta, as my last name or both?
Speaker2 : Both
Speaker1 : Yeah, that's what I put. So it is a little strange that it's asking me for a. Proof of name change. Divorce degree, naturalization certificate, or other court documentation. Um. Let me see if I can select the option for doing this later. Review fees agreements and closure
Speaker2 : Or let me send you another form. Okay, you can ignore that form and let me send you another form and please double check the names you're placing there. Okay.

Speaker2 : Hey, hello, my name is Christian. So I Had a job I was partnered with, I guess. With you guys when I was working on my other. Job And now since I've been a little bit busy lately and now since it's like I have time to transfer everything, I just wanted to transfer my 41k balance. To Principal And principal told me to call you guys about that. And I To say This 1st. I don't have information. Like that If I could give you like. My social security number and stuff because I actually try to do it on my own like the login or like try to create it so I could transfer the balance And it actually told me to contact an advisor from you guys. So I tried to do it on my own. But it told me to contact you guys. Like personally So I have to. That's why I'm on the call right now. But principal did tell me. To call you guys so that you guys could basically send them like the confirmation and they get approved. By it and then that the balance could transfer over to them.
Speaker1 : Okay sir, not a problem in that case. We can definitely help you with that. Nothing to worry in this case. Could you please confirm to me what is your 1st and last name again?

Speaker1 : Thanks so much. Let me repeat it back to you. 347-433-9370.
Speaker2 : Correct.
Speaker1 : All right, thanks so much for that, Sanchez. Thanks so much for that information, sir. I can see it here that you have all our traditional Ira with us. So In this case, you were mentioning that you want to move the funds directly to principal, right?
Speaker2 : Yes.
Speaker1 : Okay. So in this case, there are things that this process cannot be done on the website, even though that you have already created your online account, because I can see it here that the process was successful. This process cannot be done through the website. The process that we will need to do is like this principal will need to send us paperwork for requesting the transferring financial directly to them. If you want, I can send you an email with the information that principal will need to include on their paperwork and also where they can send us their own paperwork. Once we receive the paperwork, sir, it will take a maximum of five business days for the request to be approved. Once approved, we will send the money directly to principal.
Speaker2 : Okay. So to clarify what the process is is that I gotta now send the, like, do I have to call principal, tell them that I called you guys? I have an email. Then they have to do the rest on their end and then call back. 5 min.
Speaker1 : Not necessarily for you to give us a callback unless if you want to check the statuses, but it's not mandatory. This case only, we want to check Of that and remember that the five business days are coming from the moment that we receive the documents from principal, once we receive the moment documents from your principal from that point. That you will start counting the five different states.
Speaker2 : Okay. I guess I gotta call principal back because I was just on the phone with them because apparently I just found out that. My 41k paycheck hasn't even been pulling out lately at all, ever since I've set up an account. For them, but I was never informed that. but now since I have time to do everything. I'm trying to finish everything with this whole thing, but regardless, I have to wait a year. In order for me to start getting money pool from my paycheck, but I got to call Hr. To talk to them about that. That's a whole nother conversation. Yeah. so. All I have to do now is that you're going to send me an email and I call. Principal
Speaker1 : Yeah. You can, you can forward the email that I'm going to send you directly to them to the financial advisor or the person that is helping you with your Ira and they can start the process as long as. As long as all the information that we require. Is included into the paperwork for us. it's okay.
Speaker2 : Okay. My email
Speaker1 : Yes, please.
Speaker2 : Chris E. Sanchez 20 5@gmail.com
Speaker1 : Excellent. Thanks so much for that. All right sir, I just sent you the email. Can you please check if you receive it?
Speaker2 : Yep. So all I have to do, all I have to do is now I got the email, all I have to do is now call. We call this Principal, principal. And then whoever, whoever does this. I just, whoever picks up the phone call in principle. I just ask them for their email and send it to send this to them.
Speaker1 : Correct, sir. In that email, sir, is not only the information What they need to include on the paperwork, but as well including the information where they can send us the paperwork. One last thing that I wanted to mention. Once we receive the paperwork and we have approved the request for the transfer to principal, there will be a closing fee of $25. These $25 will be automatically deducted from the account balance, but only once we have approved the request. All right.
Speaker2 : All right, let me give principal a call, send this to them, and then. How long do, like you said, five business days, right?
Speaker1 : Correct from the moment that we received the documents from principal, five business days maximum.
Speaker2 : Okay. Right.
Speaker1 : Okay.
Speaker2 : Alright, let me call principal now then. I got the concert, the email and stuff and then send it to them and then. Play the waiting game part and then that's it and everything else is on my end because I guess I gotta call H R.

Speaker1 : The Oregon
Speaker2 : Okay, good then. So at the end, it's going to ask you for your Id again. I believe it won't let you go forward, so it'd be best to do it again even though we already have it.

Speaker2 : I just talked to an executive. He gave me some directions. We wanted to Obviously he gave me a direction that I connected to Robin Hood, but now I need. You guys to get me more information for the withdrawal. So basically. In short, We already have an Ira account. Sorry, you just came in. It's everything is so fresh in my brain. Let me get you up to number one. We have an Iran account with you. That was transferred from my prior employer, Ami Precast, about 6000 some dollars, but I want to get that out over to my Robinhood Ira account. So Hp, give me the list of process. That I was following. That doesn't work. You guys don't have a Dtc number, so Robin Hood cannot do that automatic transfer, things like that. So the prior executive suggested me get in call with Robin Hood. I got in call with Robin Hood. And Robin Hood is saying that no need to do anything for us, simply inspire by a check. And they have to send that check over to Robinhood with the details. That's it. And process is complete. It's what they are saying, simple. So they gave me the address. They gave me the checkmate too. And that's all. As simple as that.
Speaker1 : Okay, got it. But the process is different now, sir. Anyway, I need your name, please.
Speaker2 : Yeah, so. The name is S as Sam, O as Orange, N as Nancy. As apple, L as Lima, I as ice cream.
Speaker1 : Okay, Mr.. SE. Thank you. Could you confirm please, the last years of your social?

Speaker1 : And your phone number.
Speaker2 : Phone number is 3 128-688-9209. Another another phone number on the account is 312-213-0037.
Speaker1 : Okay, thank you sir. Just a 2nd. Okay, here is your account. It's a rollover traditional Iras and sorry, I need to clarify the information you want to transfer with another array or is a 401 K?
Speaker2 : Another Ira Traditional
Speaker3 : I
Speaker2 : Yeah.
Speaker1 : Okay, and they told you that you need to request a check, correct?
Speaker3 : Correct.
Speaker1 : Okay, okay, let me explain. Not easy process. In that case, if you want to request the check, taxes and penalties may apply in spite. I just need the paperwork from them no more. So they give you wrong information basically.
Speaker2 : Sorry, if I repeat that can go slow again, sir. Yeah, sure.
Speaker1 : In real sir, if you want to request a check, taxes and penalties may apply. but is a transfer a simple transfer? Tell me. Yeah, not not to me like not with my name with on the my Robinhood Ira account Yes, sir. Let me explain again.
Speaker2 : So it's kind of a rollover from you to them.
Speaker1 : And here, if you want to roll over, it's okay, it's up to you. But anyway, I need to explain well, the process. The process, you know, is a rollover. It's a transfer to another Ara. If you want to request a checks again, taxes and penalties may apply. It's the same if, e.g., in the check you have the information from your employer anyway, taxes and penalties may apply, sir. If you want to request the check, it's okay, you can do it, but it's up to you, sir. Is that okay for you?
Speaker2 : But taxes and penalties, I'm not withdrawing. I'm just rolling it over to. Another Ira, right? So it's an Ira to Ira. just the company is changing.
Speaker1 : Yeah, but the process to transfer to another Ira, to another Irs's a transfer. That is the difference between rollover and transfer. If you want to transfer here inspired, just need the paperwork from your new employer. But again, they told you that they need the check. Again, sir, that is a wrong information because nor is the process. If you want to request the check, taxes and penalties may apply, including if the check has the information from what is the way? Otherwise, what is the way?
Speaker2 : To not incur the taxes and penalties.
Speaker1 : I can see here, sir, that my partner a few days ago sent you the transfer instruction email. That is the correct way for that. It's a simple procedure, right? But Robin Hood is not saying that. Robin Hood is saying that this is what you need to do. Okay, they could share this information with you, but notice the process. Notice the correct process hitting spider.
Speaker2 : This is Contact ins of financial and request a check for the Ira transfer made out as above. Make sure. Ready? Yeah, that's what it's saying.
Speaker1 : They can say whatever they want, sir, but the process is different. Here in Inspired, we have a process.
Speaker3 : Okay, our process is the transfer is different than the Robin Hood told you. The process that Robin Hood told you, sir, nor is the correct process. This process is called. Okay, so help me out. I get, let me ask you the next question.
Speaker2 : If I don't do this with Robin Hood and I still keep my money with you guys and then for my next employer when that comes over.
Speaker3 : If I roll over to that employer that the taxes and penalties will not be applicable. Is that correct?
Speaker1 : It's correct. Yes, you're right.
Speaker2 : Okay, then I'll probably, if that's the case, I will not go ahead with Robin Hood. I'll wait for my new employer. They're not going to be doing anything until for the next six months. So until that time, my money is just sitting there with you guys. That's why I wasn't able to transfer over to another one without penalty or taxes. But if this is incurring those, I don't want to.
Speaker1 : Okay, and see if you want you can try another way. Let me explain. or sorry, let me ask you, do you have another account, e.g., A41k or in your current employer maybe?
Speaker2 : No, not yet. They will not. They don't start until the 1st years of service.
Speaker1 : Okay, sir. Like an advisor, I recommend you Thinking about these options here because again, the process that my partner told you and the transfer instruction is the right process here in inspired in order to transfer this account to another Ira without taxes or penalties. Because again, sir, if you want to request the check, sir, taxes and penalties may apply. But you have different options here in spiral here, e.g., if you want to transfer with another Ira account, you can do it without taxes or penalty. Also here is the same process, e.g., in the case that you want to rollovers not recommendable to take the distribution because taxes and penalties may apply again.
Speaker2 : Yeah, I don't want to incur any taxes and penalties. I want to.
Speaker3 : Probably just roll over without taxes and penalty. But as you mentioned, the only best option for me right now is to wait until another four, oh, one account is open and roll it over to there.
Speaker1 : Yes, correct sir. So my recommendation is take your time sir for think about this information. Okay.
Speaker3 : Yep, because yeah, not notice the ideas here that you pay taxes or penalties if at the end you just want to get here or transfer the account. So yes sir, please take your time and thinking about this option. Okay.
Speaker2 : Okay, thank you.
Speaker1 : Okay, you're welcome, Mr., I don't know if maybe you have any other question for me or it's okay by the time. No, I think we are good enough for now. Thank you. Okay, thank you sir.

Speaker2 : My Old company that I worked for had a 401 K that I had and it got transferred to your company. And I need to have it withdrawn. I've gone on and I did the whole sign up for your account thing. But the problem is it's now saying that it's pending. I'm only 45 years old and I have a 401 K and it's saying something about my, I reform that I've completed. I didn't complete an Ira form. I'm not asking it to be turned into an Ira. All I want to do is withdraw it.
Speaker1 : Okay, let me pull up your account so I can help you with that. Let me have your name and date of birth.
Speaker2 : Yeah, it's Randy Brynn, R E N D I B E R L I N. Date of birth is 05:15 80.
Speaker1 : Last four of your social and a home address.
Speaker2 : 763. Three Two Belt Drive, Lexington, South Carolina 29 072.
Speaker1 : The name of the employer that sent us your funds, Vernon Bowling. Okay, thanks for that verification and let me have a callback number for you in case we get disconnected.
Speaker2 : 746-42-2767. All thanks for that verification, Miss Berlin.
Speaker1 : So It looks like you claimed your account, which is the 1st step here. We need to have you verify your identity before you can take the funds out of here. So it looks like you did that. Today And that you can log into your account and request the distribution.
Speaker2 : Yeah, when I try and do it, it says something about it's being reviewed and it could be a couple days before. It won't let me do anything. When I log in, it says something about my. Ira, something has been submitted and it could be up to five days before. I hear anything back.
Speaker1 : Okay, so you submitted your Ira form? You should have gotten an email that says. It's an individual. What you have here is a traditional Ira. Your funds from your previous employer, from Vrs and bowling were rolled over. Your 401 K was rolled into a traditional Ira for you here.
Speaker2 : I hate that company. There's a reason I left them.
Speaker1 : Well, The good news is it wasn't a taxable transaction. It's just they kept it under a retirement umbrella, so there's no taxes or distribution incurred. But now that you want to take it out. You know, there'll be a 10 % penalty for a withdrawal and it's included as taxes on your tax return. They discussed that with us.
Speaker2 : Question though because I've heard, I mean, because here's what happened. I actually am not with the company anymore because I end up having to have surgery and without a work for a while. So I can claim a hardship. Is there any way to take it out based on hardship?
Speaker1 : So Hardship Those decisions are made by the Irs. So when you take your distribution from us, we will code it as an early. So it's up to you. To and the Irs at tax time they will let you know whether you are able to have that exception for the 10 % penalty.
Speaker2 : Okay.
Speaker1 : Between you and them at tax time. We will give you a 1099 R form next January. It notes it's an early distribution. and then you can contact the Irs and prove to them that you have some type of exception to the penalty the taxes are you'll pay no matter what. There's no exception to those.
Speaker2 : Okay.
Speaker1 : Because what's in there are pre tax dollars. They've never been taxed.
Speaker2 : Got it okay. So I now just have to wait for an email or something before I can.
Speaker1 : Did you get an email? Check your email and see if you got one that says you can now log in.
Speaker2 : Yeah, I did. And then it takes me to a page where it says that. That's all it says is a blue screen that says my form has been submitted and it could be days before.
Speaker1 : Yeah, so it's going back to this form, so try it again. It might have they sent you the email a little too soon?
Speaker2 : Okay.
Speaker1 : I can see that you can get access sometimes on the system. They do send that email too soon, which I wish they wouldn't, but they do. And then someone tries to log in and they're going back into that form again. Instead of getting in
Speaker2 : It says right here, get started with Golden Retirement Planner for free. No.
Speaker1 : Well, are you? Oh, you're looking for your email.

Speaker1 : Pardon me.
Speaker2 : Hi, my name is Lily. I am an escalation. Can you hear me? Okay, Yes.
Speaker1 : I can hear you sign.
Speaker2 : Okay, how can I assist you?
Speaker1 : So just to give you the back story, 1st I had made. Just a partial Distribution request at the beginning of the month. Over the past two and a half weeks, I've been calling just to get the status. You know, I was told that, you know, by multiple times it'll be in your deposited in New York on Thursday then it was the next Tuesday then. Last week again. I called and I spoke to a gentleman and he said, and so then a week and a half after the 1st. Parcel withdrawal request. I submitted another one. I didn't make the 1st one turn out. so the 1st one was 34, the 2nd was 41. So the guy last Friday, the service rep told me, oh. Our processing department made a mistake for some reason. they thought that was the same. Request They didn't realize it was two separate requests, even though it was two separate dollar amounts, two separate request forms on two separate, you know, a week and a half apart. I don't know why, but he said I talked to him. Now they know they split it into two separate requests. The 1st request will be in your account no later than Tuesday, which would be today. So I checked again. it wasn't in, so. I called this morning, I spoke to this gentleman named David de. He said, it looks like the processing department again made another mistake and instead of thinking it was two separate requests, they thought the 2nd request was an amendment. Again, I don't know why. And they just upped the $3400 request to 4100 and liquidated another $650 to make it 4100. He said, but he'll check into it and call and call me back. So, you know, we went back and forth. so I just spoke to him a little while ago he, I looked into it. What did he say this time? That he was right, that that's what they did. They thought it was an amendment. They're going to Separate it out so it's two requests and then just send me the whole $7500 at once. And I said, well, we talked this morning, you know, I need this money I got things' have to pay that are due that are now past due. Can't they, why can't they just send me the 4100 they already liquidated and then this cash? And I said, you know what you're saying is the same thing. The guy that said to me last Friday and said he was supposed to fix it, and he's like, well, he didn't fix it. I fixed it for you. And then I'm trying to figure, well, what you're telling me is the same thing. He told me, he's like, it doesn't matter. Then he just started going off on me. I was like, would you let me finish? And he's like, no. He's like, I'm taking care of it for you. And I was like, I need the money. Why can't they send me to the 4100? And then he started talking over me And he's like, look, I'm the customer. And he's like, doesn't matter. The customer's not always right, you know, I'm not. He's like, I'm done with you for the day. And I'm like, I'm like, what you're telling me is that you're telling me the same thing the guy told me last Friday and he did, and he's like, yeah, and he didn't do it. I told you that twice. Now, I mean, if you record the calls, you can go back and listen to what he said. And then he said, I'm done with you now. I'm done with you now. Bye. and hung up. So. 1st of all, I mean. You guys have screwed up twice. I'm just trying to get my money. And yeah, I'm a little annoyed, you know. And what I was trying to tell him is, look, what you're saying is the same thing the gentleman said last and the gentleman last Friday couldn't have been nicer. but you know, he had a, David had an attitude from the jump and then I, you know, I'm not saying I was perfect either. I then I started to be nasty as well. right. but. I was just trying to tell him that, look, if you have $4100 in cash, I've been waiting a month for the 1st withdrawal. Why can't I just get that and then you guys can finish the 2nd one? As you know, in your normal process. But you wouldn't even let me get that out. So You know, I don't understand why he reacted that way. and I still have that question, why can't they just send what they've already liquidated to cash?
Speaker2 : Well, Okay, I'm looking at it. It's in liquidation status right now, so. Not sure and I do apologize. I'm not sure. Why that happened. That's not our customer service goal. If you'd like, I can have the manager pull the call.
Speaker1 : I think you should. I think you'd be interested in what you hear.
Speaker2 : Okay. All right, I can do that. Not a problem. Now. so I see it's in liquidation. so I see that the process. Was rushed 2 h ago. It was rushed, done manual liquidation for extra amount based on the.
Speaker1 : Try to make it easy for you. Can you just tell me when the money will hit my checking account?
Speaker2 : Got involved I can't guarantee when your money is going to be in your bank account. Who's your bank?
Speaker1 : Bank of America.
Speaker2 : Okay, it should be quick. Let me see what's going on. I see a manager. Got involved and She put please process her direction on case. For both partials, it says please refresh request. So. Hopefully As soon as it gets liquidated, the liquidation process only. I understand you say that. One was already liquidated. I'm not sure. Let me look at the transaction. Can you give me a couple minutes? Is it okay if I place you on the brief hold?
Speaker1 : Sure, sure. And just so, you know, like I just pulled it up and I'm still showing that 4100 was liquidated. So I'm wondering if you just, so you know what I'm seeing, but yes, I can read.
Speaker2 : Okay, I'm going to look through the transactions. Try to get more information on you. Okay.
Speaker1 : Okay, thank you.
Speaker2 : You're welcome and may I get a good call back number for you?
Speaker1 : Yes, it's 404. 324. 3450.
Speaker2 : That was 404-324-3450. I'll be right back. Okay. Sure. Thank you. Okay, Mr. Rams, thank you for your patience. Okay. Just Sent a message to the back and I'm going to email our managers and our distribution. To see if they could get this 4100. I see in the notes that it was liquidated. I do apologize. I'm not sure. What's going on, but It's being expedited. that is all I can tell you. There's plenty of notes. I'm not sure why they didn't do it. Earlier. So I do apologize for everything. My name is Lily. What I'll do is I will look at it in a couple hours and. I see an update. I will call you. Okay, how's that?
Speaker1 : That sounds great. And again, I don't like to get anybody in trouble, but I would like that call pulled and sent because I just think you don't want people representing your company like that.
Speaker2 : Right. I understand.
Speaker1 : I mean, and I get. And I was no angel after, you know, he went off on me. So I'm not saying I'm perfect either, you know, but. That's not how you talk to customers.

Speaker1 : 407 737 0868.
Speaker2 : Just to confirm 077-37-0868. Yes. Okay, thank you so much for all that information. Mr., Hatter, I was able to locate the account. I'm seeing here that you have a traditional Ira account with us. And just to confirm, you told me that you wanted to move it to a bank account. You want to withdraw the money or move it to another retirement account.
Speaker1 : I want to move it to another Ira account with Trust Bank here in Orlando, Florida. It's T R U I S T.
Speaker2 : Okay, perfect. Yes, you are going to be able to do a transfer process from Ira to Ira. You have to know that we have a closing fee for taking out all the money of the account of $25. Okay, that's the only thing that we are going to take. Okay, that's fine. Now you will have to follow two steps. The 1st one is registering online. The system is showing me that that process was already completed. And the 2nd step. Okay, perfect. And the 2nd step is the transfer paperwork that your bank have to send us. Okay, they have to send us the request. Okay, so. To
Speaker1 : They told me Jenova was the one I spoke with yesterday and she told me that that was going to be rejected because of the. She, I was on the phone with her for 45 min probably. And She told me that that paperwork would be rejected by you if they sent it out. So I needed to fill out the e signature forms, which I filled out last night and completed. And that's that's, I thought that was the last step. Isn't there any way I can request? A rollover to have you cut me a check payable to Trust Bank. And send it to me.
Speaker2 : It's just that. We have two types of process. The 1st one is a rollover. That is when the type of account is changing. Okay, so if the account was an employer plan is going to an Ira, it's a rollover. Or if it's from.
Speaker1 : No, no, no, no, no, no, that's not, that's not the situation. I have an Ira already with Inspire Financial. I want to roll it over to another Ira account that I have with Trust Bank. I have another Ira account here in Orlando that I have with Trust Bank. I want to roll over this Inspire Ira to that account.
Speaker2 : Yeah. That was what I'm explaining you. Okay, so basically a rollover is when you change the type of account. Okay, so if this account is a traditional Ira and it's going to an employer plan, that is a rollover. Okay, But since this account is goings traditional Ira, it's not a rollover. It's a transfer process. Okay, that's what you have to explain to your bank. Okay, so. What I'm going to do right now is send you you an email. Can you please provide me your email address? Yes, it's H A T T E R Y.
Speaker1 : E At aol.com.
Speaker2 : Okay, so basically your last name then E as in edwards@aol.com Correct. Correct. Okay, perfect. So this email that I'm going to send you is the transfer instructions, Okay. The only thing that you have to do right now is call your bank and send them this email. Okay. Once they have this paperwork, they are going to send us a request. And once we have that request, we have a maximum time frame to review it of five business days. And then we mail a check to them. Okay. And For some reason, for some reason, they told you that they are not going to be able to accept this paperwork or they don't have the paperwork. You will have to make an indirect rollover. Okay? We don't recommend to do a direct rollover because it has some tax implications. Okay? Because. You request a withdrawal with us and you have like a time frame of 60 business days to send this check to them. As I said before, we don't recommend it. If you are going to do it that way, contact a tax advisor. 1st Okay.
Speaker1 : All right, well, I've already rolled over two of my. 401 Ks to my to my truest Ira account with Wells Fargo and also with Sun Trust. I had a 401 K with Sun Trust and I've already done a direct rollover with both of those and I had I didn't come anywhere close to 60 days. It was much quicker than that. Right. So I need to contact my bank, you're saying.
Speaker2 : Yes, are you able to confirm if you got the email that I sent you?
Speaker1 : I'm looking for it here. Yeah, I think I see it here. Hold on.
Speaker2 : Yeah, so usually this email that I sent you is like the fastest way to make a transfer from Ira to Ira and. They do the request and you just wait for them to make the paperwork. Okay. As I said before, if they are not accepting that, you will have to access the account and in here that you already have access. And once you access with the email and the password that you created the last time. You are going to see an option that says withdraw funds. Okay, There you can select the amount that you want to withdraw and also you can select the payment method. If you want to move it to another retirement account, it would be a check.
Speaker1 : Okay, it sounds like the best way to go then is to, um. Just to do the transfer of assets for then.
Speaker2 : Yeah, yeah, because usually you don't have to touch any of that paperwork. The only thing that you have to do is sign the document and send it to us. That's usually how that works. Okay. But it's just in case. Okay.
Speaker1 : Okay, okay, I'll contact my bank then and. I think they're asking me to sign. I think I need to e signature some forms, probably the transfer of assets form here in my email they've sent me. I've got, I was just locked out of that. so I'm going to have to call them and ask them to. Reset my Passcode so I can get in there again and Sign the documents.
Speaker2 : Yeah. So Yeah. At the moment, the only thing that we need you to do is send them this information because in that email specified all the information that we require. To send them the money. Okay, okay, okay. very good then. Perfect. Anything else that I can help you with before I let you go? No, that was pretty much it. Perfect. So if it's all. Thank you so much for contacting us, Mr., Hatter, and have a nice day. Okay, you too.

So for us to double check if our back office has any update with regards to that, we'll 1st locate your account.

I'm able to pull it up here and it shows you have this traditional Ira rolled over automatically to inspire. And let me just go ahead and take a look to the request you have submitted. Okay, And so I can check the status of that. May I place the call on hold for about three to 5 min while I check it here? Yep, no problem. Hello Mr.. Song. Thank you so much for patiently holding on the line. So I reviewed the document you have submitted yesterday and although our process for this. Set expectation also may take up to five business days to complete. And I have confirmed that you have selected direct deposit so you can just check also your bank details from time to time, see if you received it on your end already. Although as I can see as of the moment. Account is still open and Is processed completely, then automatically your account is closed with the closing fee of $25. as you might have seen during the process, but for now, when I. Check also there are no additional documents our back office is asking from you. especially this is still the 1st business day of it being submitted. So either we'll just wait up to five or six days and if ever there are documents, we definitely sent out communication via email for that.
Speaker2 : Okay, and quick question. The $25, do you guys take it out of the money that will be deposited to my account?
Speaker1 : Yes, it's going to be deducted automatically from the balance.
Speaker2 : Okay, so essentially I just have to wait the five business days until my bank. Like sends the money to me and then how would I know if my account is closed? Like if I log in, it probably just wouldn't let me log in.
Speaker1 : That's correct. Let me double check. As I can see, you're able to fully claim the account. so you have an email associated to it here. So if you go to Inspire Portal or if you like, I can send to you the direct link. So you can take a look also.
Speaker2 : That'd be definitely let me, let me have the link.
Speaker1 : And also for your active email where I can send this.
Speaker2 : Yeah, you can send it to the phone number.

When you access this link, it would ask you to enter your email address as your username. And can you still remember your password registered?
Speaker2 : Yeah, I think I remember my password.
Speaker1 : Okay, that's perfect. So yes, you can just check this and log in online. And I have successfully sent the email. By the way, kindly confirm if you received it and if you have time you can 1st check it. Before I let you go, make sure you have online access.

Speaker1 : I work for college Community now. I worked for Lynn Mawr school Districts. I worked for Springville school Districts. I worked for Cedar Center, a psychiatric group in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. I worked for Nor'west Bank in Marion, Iowa. I work for Marion Family Practice in Marion, Iowa. The one I suspect maybe it's been like 30 years ago was. It was called Lewis Systems. Then and I don't know what it is now.
Speaker2 : I see. Thank you very much for those information you provided. I was able to pull up your account. Im, seeing that you have a traditional Ira account with inspired that is not yet fully claimed. So the reason why we're getting an error on logging in because the claiming process is not yet done, but let me help you to have it process. Um. Let me see, or do you have already planning? mind what you want to do with your account. So that I can also check options on that.
Speaker1 : Well, I figured I would just. Take it to my bank and invest it in a Cd or something.
Speaker2 : Oh, I see. So what we're going to do is we will process a withdrawal, name it after you and then, or pay directly to you and then you will just invest it, whichever you want it to be invested, right? Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Okay, sure. Thank you very much for confirming that. So. Yeah, the reason why I've asked also because. Since we are getting challenges with our online portal, I have a one time link here. For processing distribution so that it will be a direct distribution and you will not have an online access. Would that be fine?
Speaker1 : I guess. or would you prefer to have online access? 1st Sorry, go on. What was my option?
Speaker2 : So 1st option is if you want to have an online access 1st before you will process a withdrawal. So that's the 1st one we're in. After we fill up the form, it will take up to three business days for you to have an online access. And then from there, that's the time that we can start requesting distribution or withdrawal. That will take up to five business days. In the 2nd option, you will not have a online access, but. You will fill the form right now and it will process directly the distribution that will take up to five business days.
Speaker1 : So I can do it. so I can just do it over the phone. Now, is that what the 2nd one is?
Speaker2 : Yeah, for the 2nd one, I can send you the link and I can stay on the line. You just need to fill it up. I will be staying in the line if you're comfortable so that if you have any questions or error, we can check. Options or we can address it right away.
Speaker1 : Let's do that.
Speaker2 : Okay, thank you for confirming. Let me just generate here the link and I have their email address where I can send the link.
Speaker1 : L U Y J E S S I E At gmail.com
Speaker2 : Thank you so much for that. I just want to confirm if I got it correctly. I got L for Lima, U for Uniform, S for Sarah, Y for Yankee, and then Jesse, J for Juliet, E for Echo, S for Sarah, S for Sharad, E for echo@gmail.com. Yes. Yes. Okay, thank you for confirming. Let me just go ahead and send you the link here. Please bear with me for a minute. And by the way, while we are waiting for the link to set proper expectation, Irs taxes and penalties may apply because it will be considered as early withdrawal. And then you will be receiving a 1099 R from us. We will mail it to you next year around January of 2026. There will be also a closing fee of $25.

Request form And what is the reason that you got. That you have. Sorry, this email Because In the page number one of your distribution request. There is missing the zip code. In this case,
Speaker2 : I'm sorry. the missing the what? I'm sorry.
Speaker1 : The zip code
Speaker2 : Zip 11385.
Speaker1 : Yes, you didn't fill out this information. In the
Speaker2 : Are you serious? and You couldn't just fill that in there. I mean, this is because the lady said is done. everything went through and it submitted. It did submit through and it went through. On the page, everything was done. It says you're going to receive it within ten to eleven days. So. It's kind of weird for me to say I forgot the email. The email address, I mean the zip code because. It won't let you go to the next page unless you sign, unless you fill out that the complete form. It won't let you go to the next page. It won't let you complete the form. So I don't know why it says I missed the zip code. It doesn't sound right.
Speaker1 : I'm so sorry for that, Mr.. Petrie.
Speaker2 : Do you, sir, do you agree with that? It won't let you go forward unless it was done already. You understand, like it didn't let me go forward unless I put the Ny from New York. besides New York, I put New York, New York. It didn't even let me go through unless I put the Ny after New York. So why would it let me go through without the zip code? Because it went through everything went through everything said, okay, everything went through. Form submitted, everything was fine. The lady said everything is done completely because she was on the phone with me. She helped me do the whole. She helped me do the whole thing on the phone with her. And she told me in the end, everything is fine. Everything is fine. Mr., Petrie, you're all set to go. So this is why I'm confused, why it'll say that I didn't put the zip code when the lady said everything was fine, everything was done through, and it went through. Do you understand?
Speaker1 : Yes, yes, I understand.
Speaker2 : But do you see why I'm concerned? Because then not even, not even, not even, not even 16 h later I get an email.
Speaker1 : Yes, I completely understand your point, sir. Please allow me one or 2 min on the line in order to. Double check

There is no way in order to confirm that information over the phone verbally, you will need to.
Speaker2 : Sir, please, because I don't understand. Yeah, I don't understand. How can they go through and then come the next day after the system said. It's all done. And actually the lady was helping do it the whole process and we spoke after it was done after it was done and she put submitted we spoke for a few minutes so I don't understand how could it all played around them She she said everything everything went through Can I speak to a supervisor, sir, please?

So please make sure that you have the plant name, the plant number, and the check payable instruction. That is for the rollers into the 401 K. For the transfer to another Ira, it's a different process. So I just sent you the transfer instructions. Once you have claimed the account for the road, you can contact the new financial institution that you want to move the funds to let them know that you want to start the transfer to another Ira.

Speaker1 : 857-08-3215.
Speaker2 : Perfect. Thank you so much. That would be 815. 7083215.
Speaker1 : Yes.
Speaker2 : All right, perfect. Okay sir. Yes, I do. See here, you have a rollover traditional Ira. And well, for this one, if you want to cash it out. The 1st step is that you will need to take control of the account by registering online. Have you ever tried to register before?
Speaker1 : You know, I actually just went through the process on the Inspire website and it says that. I think I went through everything I needed to and it says that your submission has been sent for verification and then I would receive an email. Once the review is complete and then it could take a few days due to increased volumes.
Speaker2 : Oh, I see. Okay, yeah, I see it here. So yes, you already completed that process and now you will be getting the welcome email that will give you the access to the account within. 72 business hours, but it's usually pretty quick if it didn't ask you for any additional documents. And once you have the control, then you'll be able to log in into the account to request the distribution. So. There will be an option that says withdraw. Withdraw funds and then withdraw your money that will take you directly to the distribution request you need to fill out and you need to take into account that. For the distribution, Irs taxes and penalties may apply. There is a closing fee of $25. You'll be getting a 1099 R by January 31 next year. and the processing time, once requested, is up to five business days.
Speaker1 : Okay. Are you able to or. And I'm not sure if I would have to wait till I get control of the account. 1st Are you able to tell me how much is in the account?
Speaker2 : Ah yes, you have $2334 with $0.88.
Speaker1 : Okay, I'm sorry. Can you repeat that for me?
Speaker2 : Oh yes, it is $2334 with $0.88.
Speaker1 : Okay. Okay. So I guess my next steps are just waiting until I receive. That email And then I'm able to log in and then go in and take control of the account and request the distribution that way.
Speaker2 : That is correct. So once you get the welcome email, you'll be able to log in into your account. And from there you can go to the withdraw funds option to get to the distribution request form you will need to fill out.
Speaker1 : Okay. And as far as the distribution goes. Is that something that I could set up for a direct deposit or would I have to be mailed a physical check? B.
Speaker2 : You can choose on the form, you'll have the. Option to do a direct deposit, a check, or a prepaid debit card. And take into account that if you want to do the direct deposit that needs to go through a verification. So basically once you submit your banking information. It will have a button for you to verify it. If it verifies the account, then we can proceed with the. Direct deposit. If it doesn't, you can also choose the option of the check. That will be the 2nd best option if that happens.
Speaker1 : Okay. Gotcha. Okay. I think you've answered all my questions. I guess I'll just wait till I get the email and go through the steps once I receive it. But yeah, I think you answered all my questions.
Speaker2 : All righty sir, my pleasure. Is there anything else I can help you with?
Speaker1 : Oh, you know what? I'm sorry, I do have one more question. What is The tax penalty percentage wise when requesting the distribution.
Speaker2 : Well, in terms of the Irs taxes and penalties, the Irs will charge you a 10 % early withdrawal penalty. And in terms of the. The taxes Well, we don't have like the calculation that you need to take out. Exactly. That is something you might need to verify with a tax advisor, but the website will give you the option to not withhold any taxes and pay them at the end of the year to withhold the 10 % or. Custom amount more than 10 %, you'll have those three options for the taxes.
Speaker1 : Oh, so, so I could. And I just want to make sure I'm clear on this. I could. Potentially pay that tax penalty later in the tax year opposed to having it taken out of the distribution.
Speaker2 : That is correct. You can elect to not withhold any taxes and pay them whenever you file your taxes again.
Speaker1 : Oh, okay. And this is me just asking general question too. Is it in your experience? Is it more cost effective? To just take the 10 % tax penalty from the distribution opposed to at the end of the tax year.
Speaker2 : I see. Well. In that regard, unfortunately, we are not able to offer any kind of advice since we don't directly deal. With the taxes, but it depends on what the person wants to do. Actually, it's more like. What the account holder think is best. That's why we suggest to talk to a financial advisor 1st before. Doing that process so they can give you more details about it.
Speaker1 : I got you. Okay, that's no worries. That's kind of what I figured. I Figured I would just ask, okay, so yeah, I believe those are all my questions now. I'll wait until I get the email and just go through the process after that.
Speaker2 : Alright, is there anything else I can help you with?
Speaker1 : No, I think you've answered everything I've needed and I really appreciate your time. Thank you.
Speaker2 : No problem sir. Thank you so much for calling Inspire Financial and have a good day.

So you do have two accounts with Inspir'd mentioned you to receive a call regarding on your rollover request. So let me try to review your information. Real quick for me to further assist you. So is it okay with you if I'll be placing the call on hold for three to 5 min? Let me review your account And once I have it reviewed, I don't. Okay, I'm gonna have to call back because I don't have that much time to sit right now. So I'm going to have to call back in a little while. Actually, I know what it is.
Speaker2 : The rollover was supposed to happen like over a month ago. I did this request a while ago and the company I work at now, Spectrum, we transitioned from nationwide to another company. So. If inspired, tried to put the money into nationwide, they probably couldn't. That's probably what it is. But I'm going to have to call back in a little while. I don't have more than 5 min right now.
Speaker1 : Oh, I totally understand, Miss Brennan. So how about this? Let me just. Check your account real quick for me to further assist you. Let me just real quick. So as I have checked here on my end with regards to that one, Yes. That is the rollover concern. So it showed up here that there is like a return check. So What They are trying to do is to Provide you updates regarding on this return. Check Let me try to check here on my end real quick.
Speaker2 : Okay.
Speaker1 : It showed up here that it was returned by. The 3rd party. So as what you've mentioned, yes, you're right. Due to the termination of the participants plan. Okay, so let me try. I probably need to submit.
Speaker2 : A new rollover form now that we have a different company. that's probably what I need to do.
Speaker1 : Yes, absolutely. And with regards to that, let me try to check here if what would be the time frame regarding on this one. So just please bear with me. I'll be working silently here. Allow me two 3 min. I'll be right here. Okay, thank you so much.
Speaker0 : Okay.
Speaker1 : Thank you so much for patiently waiting on the line. M. Brennan. So as I reviewed the information here on my end with regards to this return check, so upon checking your scenes, yes, the funds has been released to that check and it has been being returned to us. So we will be going to create a request. To stop the payment or to cancel that one so that it will go back to your account and after that you may. Further request another rollover. But this process, Miss Brennan, it takes some time. We'll begin to create a request for that. But you've mentioned you do have enough time.
Speaker2 : Well, how long does that take?
Speaker1 : So if I'll be going to create a request right now so it may take around. Five to 10 min.
Speaker2 : I don't have that time right now. I do have that. I have a client right now.
Speaker1 : I totally understand. So How would you want me to further assist you? So once you do have enough time. Please feel free to give us

Can I have you please state your 1st and last name for this line?
Speaker3 : Oh hi Cindy, it's a miracle that I got you again. My name is Sheila Murphy.
Speaker2 : Hi M, Murphy, previous representative Natalia didn't let me know that you're calling in reference to your ex husband's account, correct? I remember the call as well.
Speaker3 : Thank you. You're welcome.
Speaker1 : All right, so how is it that I can help today?
Speaker3 : Well, I sent I sent in the Copies of the death certificate. I wanted to, I got an email saying that. I just wanted to know where we stood at this point.
Speaker1 : Okay, yeah, let me take a look. I want to make sure that it was received and it scanned to the account and then it's going to be a clear copy. That typically is 20 business days for them to review and then they get back to you as far as any next steps regarding this account. So it's probably just going to be in that pending status, but I'd like to verify.
Speaker3 : Okay.
Speaker1 : Bear with me. It's taking a while for it to load. I clicked on it a bit ago. How's your day going today so far, Miss Murphy?
Speaker3 : Not too bad. It's going to be hot today, but I don't plan on leaving the house.
Speaker2 : And then I apologize, I should have done this earlier on the call, but I do need to confirm your address, Miss Murphy.
Speaker3 : Yeah, it's 20. Two Zero Canal Street Apartment One R in Millbury, massachusetts, 01527.
Speaker2 : Thank you and I do still have it here from last time, but can I confirm a good phone number for you?
Speaker3 : Sure. seven seven. 2761155.
Speaker1 : Thanks, that was 774-27-6116. I'm sorry. 1155.
Speaker3 : Correct.
Speaker1 : All right, bear with me on hold here. Just a few minutes, Miss Murphy. I'm going to see if someone else can't pull up this file. It seems like for some reason right now mine isn't loading. Sometimes I have luck with someone else searching it for me. So just a 2nd. Okay.
Speaker3 : Sure.
Speaker2 : Thank you. Hi, Miss Murphy.
Speaker4 : Hi.
Speaker2 : So I did. Finally, it loaded for me and we were able to confirm we did receive a copy of the death certificate. It is still in the pending status. Now it's going to be up to the compliance and review team to determine, yes, we can accept it and verify that he is in fact deceased so that we can move forward with any movement of any accounts located here.
Speaker4 : Okay. Yeah, that is the. That is the best Copy that I could receive from Algeria. It took, you know, it took quite a while for, because his daughters obviously wanted proof. And his brother said he had to get it translated and blah blah blah. That's finally what they sent us.
Speaker2 : I can see that there are the parts of it that are translated and everything. My worry of them not accepting it honestly is going to be that it looks doctored. To be honest, there's just no other way of putting it that it looks doctored with some spots of the things not lining up accurately. But I get that they were trying to. Translate that information so that it is legible for us. but again, it's going to be subject to review. This is the best that you have. It's what you have. So we'll review it. If it's not acceptable, then we will let you know in the email and. Maybe even if that original is available without the translation. And then we translated ourselves. I'm not sure what occurs in this situation whenever it is a four and one, but. Yeah, again it's just subject to review and I can't say because I'm not part of that team that would accept it or not, but.
Speaker4 : I understand. Are you able at this point to tell me? How much money is involved or.
Speaker2 : No, ma'am, we do still need to confirm the validity of the death certificate 1st and confirm that the client is deceased before we're able to release any information. We also need to determine beneficiary before we're able to release information.
Speaker4 : You have to determine what. I'm sorry it broke up.
Speaker2 : Who the beneficiary is.
Speaker4 : Oh, okay. All right.
Speaker3 : I'm not sure how I would go about.
Speaker4 : Something more official You know, from Algeria. It doesn't sound like it would be an easy process, but I guess I'll just wait and see what they say as long as they know that that is what we received from his family.
Speaker2 : Right. I mean, maybe if it's possible, if the family is able to. Provide you with a copy of what they received, you know, even if it's not translated, just what the original one looks like. Might work
Speaker4 : Yeah, it does look a little weird, doesn't it? Like certain areas have been. Yeah, it does.
Speaker2 : And I get that they were probably, you know, they put municipality over their word of municipality.
Speaker4 : But
Speaker2 : It's just the way that everything is lined up and it's just very obviously. Doctored so I don't know if our compliance team will be able to accept it. But it's what you have, so let's submit it and see what they say. But again, the review of that could take up to 20 business days.
Speaker4 : Okay, all right. great. I'm going to work on my end to see what we can.
Speaker2 : Yeah. Whatever other documentation you receive are, or if they are able to send you that original one, go ahead and send it as well just to that same email to the life events at inspire financial.com and then. Yeah, and then we can go ahead and review everything that you've sent in.
Speaker4 : Okay, all right, thank you. I appreciate it.
Speaker2 : Yeah, of course, Miss Murphy. Well, thank you for calling in today and I do hope you have a great rest of the day. Okay?

Speaker2 : And if I Have been married and have legally changed my last name. I'm assuming I should update that in here, correct?
Speaker1 : That is correct. and it is most likely that either at the end. Or after that, it will ask you for a name change document like your marriage certificate. Okay. And is it letting you continue with the process, with your information and everything?

Speaker2 : 239-309-6007.
Speaker1 : Just to confirm 239-309-6007, correct? Yes. Okay, thank you so much for all that information. Mrs., Terrell, I was able to locate the accounts and see here that you have two accounts, one in a traditional Ira account and the other one is a rough Ira. And just to confirm you are calling because you have some general questions about these accounts, correct?
Speaker2 : Yeah. I was trying to see What are the penalties if I were to try to. I guess get some of the money out.
Speaker1 : Okay. So, 1st of all. If you want to withdraw the money from this account, you have to know that we have a closing fee for $20. Okay. So if you request a partial distribution, we are not going to charge it. We are going to charge it once you withdraw all the money. Okay. It's $20 for the traditional and $20 for the rough account. Okay. Also. Well, for the traditional Ira, you will have to pay taxes and penalties. I cannot provide you an exact amount, but I can tell you that the penalty is the 10 % of the gains of the account. I'm sorry, of the 10 % of the total amount for the Roth account, you don't have to pay the taxes because the taxes were already paid. It's a post tax account, but the penalty is the 10 % of the gaining of the account. Okay.
Speaker2 : Yeah. Go ahead.
Speaker1 : For the taxes you are going to receive 05:10 99 in January so you can report that money with the Irs. Okay.
Speaker2 : Okay.
Speaker1 : Okay, perfect. Yeah, go ahead, continue.
Speaker2 : Okay, and how would I go about doing that? Would that be like a hardship withdrawal? How does that work?
Speaker1 : Okay, so to make a withdrawal process, you will have to follow two steps. The 1st one is taking control of this money that this process is made on the website. And the 2nd step is the distribution form that you are going to find in the website. So have you ever tried to register in the website?
Speaker2 : No, I actually just finished doing your like going through the online. One and they said they were going to send me an email. Once it finished setting up. Spiro Financial Yeah, I just set it up. They sent me an email. And it tells me the fee schedule and the disclosure agreement. And it has a tracking code on it.
Speaker1 : Yeah, yeah, actually I was looking here and yeah, I'm seeing here that request. So now the only thing that you have to do is wait maximum three business days for us to review the information and then we send you a confirmation email with instructions to access the account.
Speaker2 : Okay, but If I did If I did do that, what would be my best options for doing a withdrawal? Like, is that, is there different kinds of withdrawals or? Is it just one?
Speaker1 : As I said before, it depends on the account that you want to withdraw. The Roth account, you don't have to pay taxes and the traditional you have to. there is not like a better way to do the distribution. And what we recommend is doing it in the website because there you are going to see the. Statements and all the information that you need for. Well, maybe later like a statement or the 1099 R and all that information is there in the website. Okay. I'm seeing here the forms and I'm seeing here that it seems that everything is in good order. Okay, so in three business days we should be able to send you the email so you can access the account. Once you access the account, it's really easy because you just go to an option that says withdraw funds. Okay, And that will show you. The distribution form that you have to fill out with the information of the payment is going to ask you for the amount that you want to withdraw. It is going to ask you for the Ta withholding if you want us to pay the taxes for you. And it's going to ask you for the payment method. In the payment method, you can select a direct deposit to a bank account. Or a prepaid debit card. And after you complete that form, it's going to have a timeframe of maximum five business days and then we send you the money. Okay.
Speaker2 : Okay, alright, but I'll be able to do all that in three days. I can go on to the account and fill out the forms you said. Or complete Setting up the account and then There'll be a form For me to fill out. It's just on the website and then you guys will get the information.
Speaker1 : Yes, don't worry. All the process can be online. Once you access the account, you are going to see accounts and the options that you have and the system is going to guide you step by step to do it. Okay.
Speaker2 : Okay, thank you.

So you will receive a 1099 R formed on January 2026 the next year to fill up the taxes as well. If you take out all the funds, this account. Will be closed and there is a closing fee of $20 to zero.

Speaker1 : No, I did not. I They emailed me some forms to send out and I didn't ask for that. However. What I'm kind of wondering is like, okay. I received statements and it said that at one point here. My market value was $3133.18, but when they're sending, they said they're sending me a card. Okay, I, I had kind of asked for a check, but I mean, you know, I'll just take the money, but they're sending me $2590.33. Why is there a difference of $542.85? The account opened in 21.
Speaker2 : July 22 and it was funded $3201 and 80, excuse me, $0.28. There have been annual fees of $35 since 21, so. 2220 03:24 and let's see, yeah, and 25. So we've taken five years of $35 annual fee.
Speaker1 : Okay, but then okay, when they. Then okay, I know. It says a. $35. Okay, I see that on the statements. And as of 23. Okay, but then it says that they take that, but then I'm getting other. Aren't I getting something else here? There's a $10 debit fee. Is that what that is? Okay. So you're telling me. Since 22, I guess you said it was that that came to 500. Okay, that came to 540. $2.85
Speaker2 : I haven't done the math, but. Those are the fees that were taken out. One moment.
Speaker1 : Okay.
Speaker2 : Thank you for your patience. We've taken out $225 over the last five years.
Speaker1 : Okay. And then, so then what is the difference? I mean, there's.
Speaker0 : Okay, so from what I'm seeing, okay, this statement I have is from 23.
Speaker1 : 2023 and it says that, you know, that I had at that point. I said I have $3103.72. So Why am I not getting pretty close to that amount of money?
Speaker2 : Did you have taxes taken out? Let me see. Taxes. Yes.
Speaker1 : Okay, can you send me some kind of a statement showing me. Where they take that stuff out. Is that possible?

Speaker1 : Hello Janice, this is Lila Saves with Helium Advisors and I'm calling on our client, Donald Ebel, Junior's. Inspire Ira
Speaker2 : Okay. Did you have the client's account number?
Speaker1 : Yes, 2931. 42899.

Speaker2 : Okay, and Layla, for security purposes, could you verify the last four digits of your social?
Speaker1 : 6268.
Speaker2 : Okay, and how can I help you with Donald's account?
Speaker1 : A couple of things The 1st one He mentioned getting an email from Inspire. About E statements and also where fees should be deducted. I don't know if he set it up, but can you tell if the account has been set up for electronic statements rather than paper? and if not, how can that get set up?
Speaker2 : Let me take a look.
Speaker0 : So
Speaker2 : One moment, I have to go into another part of the account.
Speaker1 : That's fine. Thank you for checking.
Speaker2 : So the statement, you're wondering how he is set up for statements, correct?
Speaker1 : Yes, he would like to have.
Speaker2 : Online statements
Speaker1 : So does online mean that he has to log in to see the statement rather than inspiring?
Speaker2 : We don't email statements. They get an email notification stating that the statement is available. Is that maybe what he received an email notification that the statement is available?
Speaker1 : Maybe so that's, I just, I'm just trying to check how the accounts set up and how it works. so. You see it as set up for online, meaning that any time a statement is available, Inspire will send them an email and say, you know, log into the portal to view your statements.
Speaker2 : Correct. And, you know, I think statements just became available today, so they may be sending out for the June 30 statement, so they may be sending out emails like now. So maybe that is what he may have received.
Speaker1 : Okay, are you able to tell if he's set up access to his online access but that he's able to get in and view?
Speaker2 : Let me check. He created a username. I can't provide that though, but I can let you know that he created the username so. Once A username is created that means he's created his online access.
Speaker1 : Okay, yeah, that's fine. I don't need his username, but. okay, so I'm just trying to figure out. So then the other thing. That I think he said The other day there was an email regarding where fees should be charged and I used our personal checking account. Believe it should be my Ira Could you fix the problem? So Are you able to tell? Where the, you know, I guess it's just the only fees that inspire a charge. Are the annual alternative investment custody fee, correct, or are there other fees?
Speaker2 : Correct. And he set up his account information. For it to be ach out of his bank account, the annual fee. So he's.
Speaker1 : Regretting that Yeah, he doesn't. He doesn't want it to come out of his bank account. He wants it to come out of the inspired Ira, to debit the Ira. How can he change that?
Speaker2 : Well, the client have, does the client have cash in the account? Let me check.
Speaker1 : Yeah, there's $351.49.
Speaker2 : Let me see. He does not have an annual fee due right now. It has not been assessed to his account yet. Maybe like next month it'll get assessed to the account. There is cash right now for the account. I mean, for. That much that would be due, but it's not assessed yet so we can't direct debit it. The client did just on the 21st set up his Ach information. So he doesn't want that any longer.
Speaker1 : Correct. He's changed his mind.
Speaker2 : Because it said updated from invoice to ach. So The advisor can send like you as the advisor can submit an email request stating to. Change the client's payment method from Ac to direct debit from his account. But if next year, if the client doesn't have cash in his account. He'll get an invoice and then probably charged a late fee. Because we don't send out invoices until after, if it's set up for direct debit, they'll go ahead and try to pull the fees from the account. And if there is no cash available. Then they will send an invoice and at that time it may be assessed a late fee. It depends on how long it's been, you know, when they try to pull the fees. And if it's like, you know, 30 days later and there's no cash in the account, they would charge a $30 late fee. So the client would generally have to have cash remaining in his account every year when his fees come due for it to be direct debit, just so you're aware and the client is aware.
Speaker1 : Got it. Yes. if we change the payment method to direct debit. Okay, that's good. Thank you very much. We need an email request to do that. Okay, so but and it's okay if I, if the
Speaker2 : The advisor can submit that request. You know, if the client, you know, if the client is telling you to do that, the advisor can submit that request. To change to remove the client doesn't want Ach from his bank account for the payment method and wants change it to direct debit from his account.
Speaker1 : Okay. To that Western email that we use to communicate with inspired, correct?
Speaker2 : Okay. I can look and see what region you're on. It probably is west.
Speaker1 : Yeah, we're in California.
Speaker2 : Yes, it would be West. The West mail box that you're familiar with.

Speaker3 : Hi Cindy, My name is Janet. I am the wife of the gentleman whose. Insignia or inspired Monies are with and I cannot use my cell phone today. It is not allowing me to progress with any kind of enrollment, et cetera, et cetera. We've spoken to one agent earlier. And we overdid the number of times that you're allowed to use to try to log in. And now I try to log in once and it says you're already logged in too often. And I waited an hour and a half. So please This is a request to have his funds. Distributed to him by check.
Speaker5 : Please
Speaker2 : Okay, so yeah, we can definitely help with the distribution requests on that account. Now, is your husband there with you, Miss Janet?
Speaker3 : He's he's taking a nap and he lost all of his ability to speak when he spoke with Stephanie earlier.
Speaker2 : I do apologize. Ma'am, I understand you're trying to assist them with this, but we do need the account holder on the line to verify their own personal information and authorize you on the line.
Speaker3 : He did all of that earlier with Stephanie.
Speaker2 : Once the line is disconnected, then we do need to re verify that information.
Speaker3 : If the man can't speak, what do we do?
Speaker2 : How were you able to verify earlier with what Stephanie man?
Speaker3 : He was speaking
Speaker2 : All of that Because we do need verification from the account holder prior to assisting you with anything on his account.
Speaker3 : He already did that.
Speaker2 : Again, ma'am, once the line is disconnected, that verification is no longer valid. It's only valid during that phone call.
Speaker3 : Money and not ours. Okay. Cindy, this is Very frustrating. I cannot help it that my phone is not allowing us to complete the transaction.
Speaker1 : I understand it's frustrating, Miss ma'am, but if you call back and he's able to verify, then we may be able to assist with doing that distribution in a different manner. Online is not the only option. We do also offer to send the forms to complete that transaction.
Speaker3 : By mail.
Speaker2 : Yes, we can send those out by mail.
Speaker3 : Then that's the way to do it, please.
Speaker2 : Okay, but again, I cannot bring up an account or view anything without the account holder on the line. We do need to verify that with the account holder and then we can go ahead and put in the request to mail out those forms without verifying with the account holder. I can't even pull up the.
Speaker3 : Without him.
Speaker2 : Have to put in the request of the forms to be sent on the account holders profile. I cannot pull up the account holder profile without the account holder on the line B.
Speaker3 : But why will you let us do it by phone when I've already, I can tell you our account, et cetera?
Speaker2 : I understand that and it's probably the same as the relationship I have with my own spouse. You know, I do a lot of stuff for him, but at the end of the day, it is supposed to be the account holder that does the transaction. and he authorized you earlier to act on his behalf. That was during that phone call. We'd have to have the account holder verify again for this phone call.
Speaker1 : Sam, are you still there?
Speaker3 : I am
Speaker4 : Yes.
Speaker2 : Hi, this is Cindy with inspired financial on a reported line.
Speaker4 : Yes, this is. yep, you know, John Burroughs speaking.

But I understand that, you know, you're having some trouble getting logged in online to request those funds. If you prefer, what I can do is I can send you that paper form via email so you can print it immediately, or I can send it to you via regular mail so that it arrives at your home address.
Speaker3 : Let me see if my. oh no, my phone's not. It's only on what's known as Sos, so I can't use the phone.
Speaker1 : Okay, so then let's go ahead and have the paper copy of that distribution form sent out. We'll require that form to be completed and sent back to us, which can be sent back via email, fax, or regular mail, but with a copy of Mr., Burroughs, I D, or driver's license. Okay.
Speaker4 : Sure.
Speaker1 : All right, now bear with me on hold for just a few moments while I put in the request to have that mailed. And I just want to confirm we're sending that to his home address, the 17 02:22 Blanchard Lane, East in Clayton, New York, correct?
Speaker3 : Correct. And it's 1324.
Speaker1 : Yes, 13624. Yes, sir. All right, just a moment, please. Hello, Mrs. Burroughs. Yes, Cindy. Thank you for holding.

Speaker3 : Okay.
Speaker1 : Click on it should bring up a login box your email. Is your username and then if you remember your password, put your password in there or sometimes people save them.
Speaker2 : I've been trying to log in and it keeps telling me something's wrong with it, wrong email or password, but I'm.
Speaker1 : Like
Speaker2 : Sure.
Speaker1 : The email is definitely right, so just do a password reset, Have them send you a link to your email.
Speaker3 : Okay.
Speaker2 : Okay, go ahead and reset it, I assume. Yeah, reset it.
Speaker1 : Yeah, so what happens with accounts if you leave a job, you don't take your 401 K, they'll only keep it for, you know, a little bit of time and then they kind of push you out. So that's kind of. That's how we get it.
Speaker2 : It say what job it was from by chance it just it was a resigned from a different firm.
Speaker3 : Okay, but it did initially, it does show Transamerica, so I just kind of went with that.
Speaker1 : It looks like it went to one firm and then it came to us.
Speaker3 : Okay.
Speaker2 : It's working on logging in.
Speaker1 : Okay. Now we do a two step verification. You may get a text, you have to put that number, that text to you.
Speaker3 : Okay.
Speaker2 : Should it take a little while, it's like it's halfway loaded and it's not loading anymore.
Speaker1 : Your account page.
Speaker2 : Yeah.
Speaker3 : The loading bar at the top, it's only halfway and it's like it keeps redoing itself or something.
Speaker1 : Is your connection to the internet really good?
Speaker3 : Yeah.
Speaker2 : Okay, I can try getting off the Wi Fi too and see if that would help.
Speaker3 : Okay, it wants me to try. Oh, well, okay, I'm going to try it again.
Speaker1 : Okay, no, that's okay.
Speaker2 : Okay. I'm on the page now. Oh, you're in. Okay. What are you looking to do with the account? Are you taking it out for your personal self, rolling it into a new employer plan? I'm not sure. I guess I haven't thought about it. I didn't really know anything about this. I've never been contacted about this before, so.
Speaker1 : Oh, okay.
Speaker2 : Yeah, this is the 1st I'm ever hearing about it, so. I can either take the money or move it to an Ira that I have currently. is that those are my options? You can, if you take it out, there's penalties and taxes that will apply. But yeah, you can get it transferred out. Now, if you're transferring it out to an Ira company that you already have, they would request it, possibly with an Ira to Ira transfer form or an acceptance letter.
Speaker1 : Instructions Our processing time is about ten. Sorry, five business days as long as everything's in good order and then we send a check directly to them as the address on file. If you're looking to take a withdrawal for yourself, any type of penalty in taxes. That may apply for you with that early withdrawal. We also have a closing fee of 25 for the account. We kind of follow whatever the 401 K was that you had. So that's where we get that. but. We can get it closed for you. Absolutely. And get it all sent to you depending on what you're looking to do with it.
Speaker3 : Okay.
Speaker2 : Do I have to decide right now or can I call you?
Speaker1 : When you're ready, you'll actually go through your form there. There is a withdraw form. Under you'd look for withdraw funds, withdraw your money if you wanted to take it out. I'm going to send you another. since you suggested the Ira to another company, we don't have our own transfer paperwork, so say you want to take it to Fidelity. I use Fidelity because they're my 401 K plan here. You talk to your rapid fidelity and say, hey, I have an account with inspired. Everything's claimed on it and I'd like you to request it to come to you. So it's all here. We don't have transfer paperwork, so I was always like to send this transfer email out to you. You could always forward it onto your rep at whatever firm you're using and then they will see, you know, what we're actually looking for for transfer paperwork. It has our address on that form. It's got a fax number. We will take faxes and. Also, some scan them, some do not, but there's also an email address on there.
Speaker3 : Okay.
Speaker1 : Okay, but we're here. Any questions you want to, you know, ask or anything if your person may ask for. Hey, can you know you get a statement for your account while you're in your account page? There you want to look for the wording documents. and again, that could be under the dots or possibly the bars, but you'll go into documents and then create a report.
Speaker3 : Okay.
Speaker1 : Okay, that'll have full account number because I know the reps need to know full account number for transferring and it'll have your balance how your name is here showing that it is a traditional. But that shouldn't be a problem if they ask for something like that. That's how you get that.
Speaker3 : Okay.
Speaker2 : Perfect.
Speaker1 : We're here, we'll help you. Okay.
Speaker2 : Sounds good. I'll probably end up calling you guys back.
Speaker1 : That's okay, we're here. Keep us busy. All take care, ma'am.

Speaker1 : Thank you so much for your cooperation Alexis. So yes, I can see here that we a rollover traditional Ira and the account is actually not yet validated but you mentioned that you are trying to say to set up the account online. May I ask What page are you in on that process?
Speaker2 : Yeah, so right now it says statement preference. Would you like to receive paper statements by mail in addition to online statements? That's the
Speaker1 : So we're actually almost done, Alexis, but the process is actually for account validation for you to have access to your account online and you can request for rollover using the portal once you have access to it online. So yes, if you have to, statement preference. An additional fee may apply, but if you click no, you will still receive the statement through email.
Speaker2 : Okay.
Speaker1 : And then after that you will need to review the fee schedule. Once you have the fee schedule file up and reviewed, kindly close that and you will go back. You will be back to that page and I think the permission has been sent for verification. Okay, great. So let me check if it reflects here as completed. Allow me a moment. Okay, so thank you so much for your time, Alyssa. So you completed the Ira form, so please allow us up to three business days to validate it. So once the validation is completed, you will be receiving a welcome email from Inspire that contains instructions on how you can access your account online. And that's the time that you can request for the rollover. And by the way, just to let you know, Alexis, that rollover comes with a closing fee that's $25 Irs taxes. I mean, it's not taxable, but it's reportable. So you will still see the 1099 our next tax year for reporting purposes. So rollover takes five business days to process once we receive the documents in good order. And also And by the way, an additional information for you. Before you can fill out the form for rollover, I will need you to contact your employer's plan 1st to ask for the rollover instructions since we will be asking those information on the form. So that includes the. The check payable instructions, the plan, I have their number. That's quite bad.
Speaker2 : I have that for you. Do I just fill that out on the form?
Speaker1 : Yes. You can keep that and you will be needing to put that on the form once the account is validated, once you are able to access to the online.
Speaker2 : Once that form is completed, do I fax that back to you guys?
Speaker1 : You can actually do it online. Okay. A link You can request for that. Using the portal once you have access to the account online. So by the way, Alexis, the check will be mailed to your address and you will be one to forward to check your current employers' plan. Okay.
Speaker2 : Okay.
Speaker1 : Right. So I believe that we chat now. Is there anything else for me? Do you have any questions or clarification? It has been very helpful. Thank you. I'm glad to hear that.

Speaker2 : And they have 200 in that or is it 75?
Speaker1 : In this one it says $88423. Okay, What? They are raising more money as part of a Series B round.
Speaker2 : That I want to commit $160000 to. I have asked for additional money to be. Transfer it into the account and I sent that in a couple yesterday, I guess. So I assume you all are working with Charles Schwab to bring the money over. My question to you is this. I have a letter from them that's asking for the. basically, it was really a function of another capital call. For 160000 plus 2000 expenses or 162000. What else does Millennium Trust need to complete this or to evaluate it? It's the same. It's in the same vehicle that I have it in now.
Speaker1 : If it's a different class or series, and to me it is a different asset. Has it ever been custody on our platform before? Do you know?
Speaker2 : Well, they're just raising money for a purpose. I don't know that they have seen the specific, you haven't seen the specific paperwork on this round. For it, but it's going into the same holding vehicle.
Speaker1 : Okay, so the asset name itself is still going to be Bc Pf coined was a B as in boy.
Speaker2 : Yes, it will be. Well, of course I had the letter right in front of me and I don't now. Give me 2 s and I'm sorry not to be prepared. That's okay. I got so much paper here and I'm kind of trying to. Get into a couple of things and the loss of the Oh, I see what the problem was. Okay, it was in Docusign. My apologies. Let me figure out where the download was.
Speaker0 : Oh.
Speaker2 : I think it's just going to say proof co invest. It may not have the series three on it.
Speaker1 : Then that to me is a different asset. So if it is not already been review, then it would need to be reviewed. So I will email you. When all is needed. Give me a moment and let me ask you this question.
Speaker2 : Okay, well. Go ahead and just tell me what you think I need to do.
Speaker1 : Okay, all right, I'm going to email that over to you now. So the pre custody steps is what you do to submit the asset for approval. and it looks like you have another one in here that is pending. Review. Now where did that go?
Speaker2 : That's applicant
Speaker1 : Yes.
Speaker2 : So we've been around. It seems like this never ends for applicants. So it's about the 4th time we've sent you stuff. So I've sent it over to the lawyer to try to get you the last batch of stuff. That you need Yeah, this is going to be actually investment series four. As I look at it, I finally got the document up. It's.
Speaker1 : Yeah, it would need to be reviewed. So what I sent you is step one is the review. Step two is what you would submit for purchase. And you could do both of them at the same time because it will just wait for the pre custody review to be approved before it submits. I mean, before it can process the purchase.
Speaker2 : Is there a list? In your email, is there a list of what the proof co invest, the company running it needs to send you? Yes.
Speaker1 : It is, go ahead and check it just to see that you got it.
Speaker2 : Yeah, let me just. Something's a little, here we go. Okay. All right. I will get this over to them so they can start working on their part of it and then I will work on my part of it.
Speaker1 : All righty. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
Speaker2 : The only other question I have is how long. Does It usually take after I've submitted a request for transfer of funds from one. From Charles Schwab over to you guys. What does that usually take time wise?
Speaker1 : For incoming transfer, normally if we get everything in good order and timely, then what I would say normally within a week, but it also depends on their processing time. So we would get it, it would take us a few business days to look at it, review it, approve it, send it over to them. then we have to wait for them to send us the funds back. So I can send you the incoming transfer form. So if you're asking to transfer funds from them to us, then there is a form that needs to be completed for that as well and I will email that over to you now. Okay, Yeah, I filled one two days ago.
Speaker2 : I had great difficulty. The interface between Millennium Trust and Charles Schwab. It would not now let me log into Schwab directly. So I go out a form and send it. Yep. And I do see, let me see, the notes signed incoming transfer form has been approved for a cat. so it is processing. and that latest email was today.
Speaker1 : So yep, we're already working on that. Perfect. All right. Well, thank you very much. I appreciate your help. You're very welcome. Is there anything else I can assist you with?

It was a different Etf, but the same company. It was the same thing. The woman who did the trades those two times, she had to check to make sure it was. And she came back and found that yes she could buy it And I think it's because it's it's on the Nyse but there's like a there's an electronic sub market of the Nyse That is traded off

Speaker3 : And the address we have on file for you as well as the name of the employer the retirement plan came from.
Speaker2 : Should it be 2520 North 44th Drive, Phoenix, Arizona, 85035? And the employer was a tech.
Speaker1 : Is there another address that you would have had, Mr.? Lopez?
Speaker2 : If it Would have been 5604 South 55th Lane. In Levine, arizona, 85339.
Speaker1 : Thank you. And Is there another employer that you would have had as well?
Speaker4 : No.
Speaker2 : Not with this plan. And what's the best contact phone number for you? 602 2977872.
Speaker3 : That's 602 2977872, correct? All right, the reason I'm asking Mr. Lopez is yes, I do see an account here from Peckham. I also show that you have another retirement plan that has been sent over to us as well. So you do have a Roth Ira that we received from this employer back in December of 2024. However. There is also another traditional Ira. From that employer and then you have another Ira that we received. So you would have the option with this account, of course, to roll it over to another employer's plan, transfer it out to another Ira, reinvest with Ins spiral, or withdraw the funds. And how can I help today?
Speaker2 : Okay, so that is three times that I have you saying, or is it two?
Speaker3 : It is three accounts. So you have one Roth Ira from Peckham and then you have a traditional Ira from them and then you also have another traditional Ira from another employer.
Speaker2 : Got it okay. All righty. So basically what I need. So you were able to locate my account, correct?
Speaker1 : Yes, the accounts are populated here.
Speaker2 : Right. Yeah, because I don't know, I've spoken, I don't know with how many representatives and. I was told to call the other agency and asks like the rollover date, the rollover amount, the method and all that. But thankfully you found that. Do you have the balance there in front of you? For those accounts.
Speaker1 : I do. I show here for the Roth Ira with Peckham. you have a total market value of 1000. 600
Speaker3 : $73.72 for the traditional Ira. With them you have a total market value.
Speaker1 : Of 1000, I'm sorry of $241.17 for the traditional Ira.
Speaker3 : And the other employer that was sent over to us, that is also a traditional Ira, and that one has a total market value of $2141.61.
Speaker2 : Does it give you that employer? By any chance.
Speaker3 : We do, but we cannot provide it to you. We can only confirm yes or no. Do you want to provide me with the name of potential employers that you would have had?
Speaker2 : Yeah. Would it be Arizona Public Services?
Speaker3 : No, it's not showing that here.
Speaker2 : Amazon
Speaker4 : No. Where else have I worked? Okay. Okay.
Speaker2 : Is a microchip
Speaker1 : No, so we did get this account, it looks like back in January of 2019.
Speaker4 : 2019 Well, I don't know.
Speaker2 : Um, okay. All that works. I should be so it's not pet cam.
Speaker4 : No, so you have the account from Peckham. So what you would be able to do is you can either, like I said, once you take control of the accounts, which you would do that by registering on our website, I can send you the link here via email because we do not process any transactions over the phone. I would just need your email address. I will send you the link here to claim it. Once you go ahead and put your information, we would verify the information that you submit and then you'll receive a welcome email from us within three business days letting you know that you have access to the account. From there, you can either roll it over, transfer it out, reinvest, or just simply withdraw the funds.
Speaker2 : Got it all right. Yeah, I would love that text please.
Speaker3 : So it'll be an email. May I have your email address?
Speaker2 : It is Nestor, 1st name G. Lopez 90 6@gmail.com
Speaker1 : Alright, so that's Nestor Lopez 96@gmail.com correct?
Speaker2 : And would you be able to update my address on there?
Speaker1 : We're, so when you fill out the link here to claim the account, that's what you're going to input all of your updated information. So once you click on the link right below the 1st paragraph, it'll tell you that your account information. Has been located and then you would enter in anything that needs to be changed. Phone number, address, email, all of that you would enter here.
Speaker4 : Sounds good.
Speaker1 : And then I just did send the email. It will come from rollover Ira customer support if you can confirm that you have received it.
Speaker2 : Yes, I have it here.
Speaker1 : Right. And then you want to click on that link right below the 1st paragraph and start to claim the account.
Speaker2 : Right. And can I do that now by myself or do you need to stay on the land?
Speaker1 : I can help you with it if you want to make sure that it goes through for you.
Speaker2 : All right, let me do it real quickly here. I don't have a code or will you be providing a code you can select? I do not have a code. We send the code out to you when we 1st get the accounts. So if you don't have it, it's fine. All righty, looks like review and accept a disclosure.
Speaker4 : Right, so let's just click, confirm the terms and conditions.
Speaker2 : Does it take a while for you to get? The verification code
Speaker4 : Do you know?
Speaker1 : No, you should be able to receive the code there once you enter in your phone number. Give me just a moment here just to see if there's anything on your profile preventing you from receiving it. How many times have you requested or was it advised to be? Was it trying to send it to you? Just the one.
Speaker2 : Twice
Speaker1 : Try it now. And Let me know if you do receive it.
Speaker2 : No, I'm not getting it. Oh, I believe I got it. 1 s okay, right? Yeah, I got it.
Speaker0 : Oh.
Speaker2 : All looks like I'm in here.
Speaker1 : All right, so then you would just go ahead and continue to verify your information from there. And again, Mr., Lopez, it does not give you that immediate. Access, you would await the welcome email to arrive and then once you do receive the welcome email, you can then sign into the account. You'll see all of the accounts there and their balances, and then you can decide on what you want to do with it from there.
Speaker4 : Okay.
Speaker1 : All right, and are there any other questions or concerns you'd have for me?
Speaker2 : No, that would be it for today.
Speaker4 : And thank you again for contacting Inspired Financial. I hope you have a great rest of your day. Thank you. Likewise. Bye bye. Thank you.

Speaker1 : Thank you. Just by any chance. Do you have a middle name, Miss?
Speaker2 : Jane is my middle name, Brandy Jane.
Speaker1 : Okay. Let me try with your middle name. So said that you have never received a letter from us from Inspired Financial, right?
Speaker2 : Not that I know of. I am going to look when I get home, but I have not. One that I've seen.
Speaker1 : Just to confirm, so probably your former employer or ex company. Mentioned that your money was transferred to this financial institution.
Speaker2 : Yes, when I chatted with them today on their website and they said that it had been transferred to you all as of July 1.
Speaker1 : July 1. Okay. That makes sense. And why? Usually I mean, I need to ask you a few more questions just to clarify the case and confirm if we have the account or not yet because usually if they send the money very recently, I know that it's like a month ago, but that process may take also a month usually. Sometimes less than that, but that's depending on the previous company. So let me just try to identify if we have that account or not yet with your address. What is the home address that we probably have on file for you, Miss Bird?
Speaker2 : It should be 2266 Mcfadden Road, M. C S. P A D D E N
Speaker0 : And that's Maryville, Tennessee, 378. Oh, three.
Speaker1 : Okay, what was the SE card again? I'm so sorry.
Speaker2 : 37803.
Speaker1 : Okay, thank you. Just Okay, let me try. With this address Okay. Okay, it looks like under this information. There's no Also An account. Sometimes we have phone numbers related or associated with the accounts. Do you know if we may have your phone number? Probably an old phone number or your current one?
Speaker2 : Okay, you can try 865.
Speaker0 : 3154900.
Speaker1 : 365-315-4900. Okay, let me see. Okay. at the beginning. Yeah, eight is five. Okay. Okay, Ms. Bird, one more time. Looks like there's no an account. so let me just clarify this case. It's okay if your previous company mentioned that the money is going to be into this inspiration, it's fine. Remember that that process may take around a month, or as I mentioned, usually less than that. From this day, it looks like we are about to. Receive the information, but Just to make sure, remember that we're going to mail you a welcome letter just to communicate that now your account is 100 % established with us. So if we don't have your account information. At least with this type of details that you provide me, your name, the last for every social home address, your it's because there's nothing related. but just for now, remember you will receive the welcome later once the account is open or just if you want, I can try to take a look on the account. It is not mandatory, but it's just to make sure that we have the account or not. I can try to check with your full social, but it's not mandatory just if you feel comfortable with that. Otherwise you can wait for the welcome letter.
Speaker0 : Yeah, I'll just wait. I just. I may have it because I'm terrible about putting stuff up on a shelf and not looking at it.
Speaker1 : Okay, yeah, I mean it's fine once you get that letter, remember you will see a Qr code so you can set up an account with us and review all your account information. But if it's necessary, whenever you receive the welcome letter, you can give us a call. Or if you don't receive the letter, it's fine if you would like to check the tomorrow or by the end of this week just to see if something came through for you.
Speaker2 : Alright, that sounds good.
Speaker1 : Yeah, that will be all for now. Miss Bart, I'm so sorry for this delay, but as I mentioned, usually it's just depending on the former employer. I'm just wondering if you have a question related to this ST.
Speaker2 : No, that's all I needed.

Speaker1 : Okay, so it's the testimonial, is it? I see. Okay. I see where it says I am the beneficiary executive of the estate. Oh boy. Okay, I. can I email that to you, can I? Sign it and scan it and email that to you.
Speaker2 : Yeah, you can do that or you could take a photo of it from your cell phone and email it, whichever you prefer. But you just want to make sure that where it asks for natural and adopted children, even if the adopted children is zero, it does require a zero placed in that spot.

Speaker3 : It could be sooner.
Speaker2 : Okay, yeah. If there happens to be any way that it can be expedited, that would be wonderful. You know, in fact, I wouldn't, I wouldn't even be doing the transfer. I'm perfectly fine with staying with Inspire, but there's some specific types of investments I want to make that I wouldn't be able to with Inspired. And that's the only reason why, I mean, I've been with you guys for a long time. But that's the only reason why I need to transfer out. And so there's some opportunities. That are available For this Ira But those windows are closing, so I'm chomping at the bit and chewing my nails and all kinds of stuff. Hoping that the transfer, I don't know if there's any way you guys you're able to expedite it, but I mean, if not, you know, I'll just cross my fingers and hope that it can take place within the next day or two.
Speaker1 : Yes, so there is. An expedited fee of $75 if that is something you were interested in.
Speaker2 : And Doing an expedited fee How much faster would that be able to make it?
Speaker1 : It would make it one to two business days.
Speaker2 : Okay. Well, you know, I mean, you guys would just take it right out of the account, right?
Speaker1 : Correct. Yes.
Speaker2 : Yeah. Okay.
Speaker3 : Well, Yeah, I mean.
Speaker2 : If you're able to, if that really. Does help and knocks it down to one or two business days. That would be great. I'm okay with that.

Speaker2 : Julian J U L I A N. Last name Garcia G A R C I A.
Speaker1 : All right, thank you so much, Mr.. Garcia. Just one moment. I have the last four of your socials and date of birth for verification.

Speaker1 : And also may I ask for your address?
Speaker2 : The address So that's the address they might have on file is an old address that I no longer live at. It might be 3303 Mesa Ridge Road, I think.

Speaker2 : Okay.
Speaker1 : So just the last word for social is 0954, correct? Yes. Yes. Okay. Thank you for confirming. Just give me a moment while I search up on your account. Okay, Okay. Looking up, I guess you have to bear with me. Mr., Garcia, I would just like to ask, you've mentioned that you received a letter. Is that from inspiring or previous employer? Again, I'm sorry. I received a letter from my previous employer and then I gave them a phone call.
Speaker2 : And they said that it had been sent, that it was sent to you guys. And it was put in an Ira and that if I want to get the money I have to call you guys.
Speaker1 : Okay. How about a letter from Inspired? Did you receive? The letter from Inspiron.
Speaker2 : I don't know because I don't live at that address.
Speaker1 : Just Currently checking or looking up for your account here. So. Just one moment.
Speaker2 : Okay.
Speaker1 : Right, so Mr., Garcia, as for checking it here, basing on the information that you have provided to me, unfortunately there's still no account pulled up here yet. We can try to double check if there was really an account or none on ours, but this will require your full Social Security number. That is only if you're comfortable providing it to me.
Speaker2 : Does it take some time? Should I just call back in like a week and maybe it will be set up by then?
Speaker1 : Actually Entire rollover process can really take some time depending on the size of the plan and the reason it was rolled over to us. So usually after we have established the account here with funded amount, we send out welcome letter to our account holders to inform them that there was already an funded account established under inspired financial. But since based on the information you have provided to me, it seems like there is still no account yet. Did your previous employer advise you if, when is the specific date that the fund was rolled over?
Speaker2 : It looks like July 28.
Speaker1 : Oh, July 28. I see. So it was actually just sent. Monday, Mr., Garcia, just allow us more time to have your account established here on our end. If in case that we are done, we will just keep in touch with you using a welcome letter. But if in case that you have not received any welcome letter from us, you're welcome also to contact our office to check on your account. But As of the moment, there is no account yet, but is there a way to.
Speaker2 : The welcome letter to change my address to where I live now.
Speaker1 : Unfortunately, there is no option for us to do it as of the moment since there is no account on the portal. So If in case that the letter will be sent to the old address, maybe your only option as of the moment is to keep or to contact our office from time to time. You can check on your account.
Speaker2 : Okay, how long do you think I wait to call again? How long does it typically take? It's not a lot of money, it's only like $600.
Speaker1 : Which I understand Mr., Garcia, but I cannot really provide or we are actually don't have a specific time frame of how long it's going to take, but you can try to contact us by next week. The same day maybe. Wednesday so that we can double check or you can check if there was an account already established. Okay.
Speaker2 : Okay, perfect. Thank you.
Speaker1 : You're welcome. Aside from is anything else or do you have any other questions?
Speaker2 : Nope, that's it.

Speaker2 : 2227. Yes.
Speaker1 : Okay, so I'm not finding an account for you either. So can you give me a little information on. How you heard about Inspire Financial? What's going on?
Speaker2 : Okay. So what I gather is That whenever I was working In Oklahoma in the oil field. They're putting away some money for me for 400 1ki. Get it all that good stuff. But now I believe I want to collect on it. It's only, it's only $7.96 according to this paper and I've already. Okay, so. From a guy that's not used to just giving information and just putting stuff out there. I received this letter and then I called you guys and then you asked me for an email. I put my driver's license and my social security and I took a picture of it. All in good faith and I sent it to you guys. Now, I don't know why you're saying what you're saying, because I did my part. I don't know. Where the email is or what's going on. This is like a month ago.
Speaker1 : Let me see if I can find. Maybe a call you've had with us in the past. Is this the same phone number you called last time?
Speaker2 : Should be. Yeah.
Speaker1 : Okay, let me see what I can find. I didn't know you had called before and we found an account for you because just right now looking at your information, I'm not finding something. So let me see. If maybe it's just us not finding it correctly. One other thing, and I don't know if it matters, but.
Speaker2 : I was purchasing some land, so in the beginning it fell under space number one, but since they redistrict everything, it's space number five. Now it's still the same plot of land, but. They sectioned it off. So I don't know if that matters because on this letter it SE space number one, but on my driver's license it says lot number five.
Speaker1 : Okay, I got you. So I think I found something. So I just need to verify you. A little bit more. Can you give me the address that we would have on record? The full address?
Speaker2 : Okay, so what I have in my hand is eleven 600 S M 2219. Space One, Amarillo, Texas 791-19-2630. But On my driver's license it says eleven 600 S M 2219. Lot number five.
Speaker1 : Okay, I got you. And what's the name of the previous employer connected to this account?
Speaker2 : Okay, so. When you worked at Or the Association
Speaker1 : Do you remember working for this company?
Speaker2 : I mean. I'm sure it wasn't called, you know what I mean? Like. The company was called Unit Drilling, but I don't know what it falls under.
Speaker1 : Okay, because Orthopedic is like medical and you're saying you're you work for an oil company so I don't know.
Speaker2 : You're saying something else. I didn't say orthopedic. Look, I'll spell it for you. It's O R. T H. P A E D I C
Speaker1 : Okay, let me look that up. Yeah, that's medical. I just looked it up. That's medical. So. What's your date of birth?
Speaker2 : Eight one 84
Speaker1 : Okay. Let me see. Because some of your information is not matching up to this account. So I'm thinking this might not even be your account and we have the wrong person and send you paperwork that's not supposed to go to you. Let me see.
Speaker2 : That'd be pretty random. Do I Yeah, I'll have him on the couch. I don't know.
Speaker1 : So it looks like the social isn't matching and the date of birth isn't matching and it doesn't really sound like you worked for this company. Do you know for sure if you worked for this medical group?
Speaker2 : Okay, now, so after you're saying all this. It sucks. You think it's a miscommunication because. I was thinking it had to be accurate just because. I've worked for other companies in the past and I've gotten these types of letters before. And There were nothing crazy, but you know, a little $500 check or whatever. But I mean. I don't know, and I'm telling you, I gave you all the information. Now I feel kind of weird because. I don't know. People don't normally do that. That's how people get scammed. And I'm not saying I did, but I was like, well, you sound legit and I. I mean my Id and everything.
Speaker1 : So we are legit. I'm not saying we're not.
Speaker2 : I'm not saying that, but if there was. A mismatch, I would have seen it right then and there and emailed me back and been like, hey brother, this is not you instead. I keep having to chase and figure it out. I don't know.
Speaker1 : Yeah, let me, let me see.
Speaker2 : I can 500 bucks. That's the only reason. I'm trying again, but I mean, if it's a misunderstanding, I understand, but. Says just so random that the same house The same exact name, but I don't know.
Speaker1 : So when it comes to situations like that, we do put out a search for account holders by their name and the address that. Could be theirs and we just could have sent You this because your name is connected to this address and if it's not yours then we can figure this out. But if you think this is yours then we can fix it but it's looking like it may not be yours because you Worked for this company.
Speaker2 : Like I said, I was hoping it was me and a lot of it made sense because. When I was working at the rig, they took all kinds of taxes. I never got to see them. So whenever I got this in the mail, I was like, oh wow. I do have a little money somewhere, but I mean. I don't know.
Speaker1 : Okay, so. Again, have you worked for this company that you told me on the form?
Speaker2 : Not directly, no. Now that you're making me read through the paperwork because I mean, I just called the phone number because it's just easier to talk to somebody. This thing looks like it was written by a lawyer. I can't understand it, but. Like I said, I just called. The verify. I thought it was me, but like you're saying, it might not be.
Speaker1 : Yeah, I don't think this is yours. And have you ever worked anything in medical before?
Speaker2 : Not directly, I don't think. That's why I was wondering. You made me read it out loud. I was like, oh, I don't know, but I was gonna say. You know how I used to work at Wendy's and it's not under Wendy's, it's under Ldf. So it's always under. It's just a big. Corporation, it's always under something else so I just didn't know. Like I said, it's unit drilling, but we were. It's like got 300 locations, not just Amarillo. It's all over the Us. So I didn't read over that name until you were like, hey, where was that? I was like, I don't know.
Speaker1 : No, for sure. I do hear you. I can see why you would be a little confused and you think it'd be yours because it has your name on it. Have you ever worked in Florida?
Speaker2 : No, that one's a no.
Speaker1 : Yeah, I don't think this is your account, so.
Speaker2 : Okay, like I said, it was just wishful thinking because I was like, oh man, I got a couple bucks.
Speaker1 : No, I got you. So what I can do is remove your address and information from this account. And That way you don't have to get these letters from us anymore because this isn't your account. Do you confirm that this isn't your account?
Speaker2 : Well, I never worked in Florida, so I guess I'm probably not.
Speaker1 : Well, I mean, you can always call your previous employer to double check what their employer name is. Like their employer type retirement name, but again, I just Googled this company. And It says Advent Health Medical Group. So like this is a company based in Florida, according to what Google is saying.
Speaker2 : Okay.
Speaker1 : It says orthopedic surgery group specializing in sports medicine.
Speaker2 : No, I've never done anything in that.
Speaker1 : Okay, yeah, I don't think this is our account then.
Speaker2 : Okay, then, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for blowing up. I just.
Speaker1 : I get it. You're fine. I'm sorry about this communication.

Speaker2 : Okay, let's do something in order that you can start the process to withdraw the money as you have the issue to log in on the account to validate your identity. I'm going to send you an email with a one time link. So that one time link is going to allow you to 1st verify your identity. So the 1st part is you have to put all of your details. Also, it will request to upload a document where we can verify your identity. And in that case, you can upload your driver license or passport or temporary or statement Id. The document cannot be expired. Okay.
Speaker1 : After that, it's going to allow you to start the process to withdraw the money.
Speaker2 : You have the option to request by check repair card or direct deposit. And when you complete the process, we will take up to five business days to issue the payment and then send to you. Also, Inspire is going to send you 1099 form because taxes and penalties may apply from the Irs and we are going to discount the closing fee that is $30. So Before opening the link, have all of your personal details near to you because it's a one time link. Once when you open, you cannot close or reload because if you do that you will need to have another link. Did you receive the link?
Speaker3 : I did. I opened it and it's telling me what I need as far as Social Security number and all that to it. And it says next at the bottom.
Speaker2 : Yes, you have to complete all of that information. I don't know if you need that. I'm staying on the line while you do the process. But if you have another question for me.

And then we will mail you a 1099 R form the following year so that you can file with your taxes.

So you trying to create your account, you're going to have problems because it's not going to match our records because you're going to have to get the correct information. So what I'm going to do instead. Is send you the registration form separately from our website so that you can update your information correctly. All right, and it will ask you for name verification. So because you haven't changed your name, you can upload your Id or driver's license for that spot. It may ask you for other verification documents, but you'll know once you get to that point.

Should I give the fidelity account number to you so that you will transfer it or should I give. Inspire account number two to Fidelity.

So the paperwork, yeah, so the instruction basically says, you know what, my account number and all those details. I need those details because I'm not able to view my account. There
Speaker2 : I can give you the account number. Just let me know when you're ready to take notes.

Speaker2 : Sorry to interrupt. basically the other employer, I'm sorry, the other Ira will need to send all the transfer paperwork on the email that I sent you there you can see the documents like the information that we need. Can you please review your email and let me know if you see it?
Speaker1 : Yeah, so I have what they are saying is your caller should provide, make sure of the following included under your signature, Inspire listed as the current custodian account type at Inspired. So that is traditional Ira. Traditional Ira, then delivery instructions for new provider including payee name, signed letter of acceptance from an authorized representative of new provider, at least two of the following Inspire financial account. Number, Social Security number, date of birth, and current address. Okay, I can provide that if the holdings include mutual funds. So what does this holdings include now? Now, I'm not sure about that. also.
Speaker2 : That is if you have like mutual funds. But in this case we are just going to send like. We are just going to send the money. Like The essence, you know. So yes, that doesn't apply to you.
Speaker1 : Okay, okay, those things don't apply. And where should I send all this? So the provider will send directly, right? So. And even if I don't want to do the wire transfer, what is the other option? Wire transfer? I see there is a, $30. So Inspire is not a bank. So how can this be done without costing me any money?
Speaker2 : We will send a check. To your new Ira

Speaker2 : 903 2770626.
Speaker1 : Alright, 903-277-0626.
Speaker2 : Right.
Speaker1 : Thank you so much for all of your information, Miss. I just pull up your accounts here. By the way, you have two different accounts here. One of these accounts is a traditional Ira and the other one is a Roth Ira account. Okay, so what do you want to do with these accounts? Well, that's what I'm calling to see because I've received a letter from Fidelity. And do you see like in the rock, is it like 9900 8377? Let me give you the balance for each account, 1 s please. In your Roth Ira account you have 9000. Hundred $53 with $0.66. That's right. Otherwise that's a different number than what I have on my papers here.
Speaker2 : I mean, it's 9983 and even the letter that you all sent me, it says that my current balance was 9900 8377. So have they taken some money away or what has happened with that? Why is it 50 instead of.
Speaker1 : The reason is because The reason is because we have a maintenance fee for your account for $35, right? So which is charged every year, We took from your amount $35 per maintenance fee.
Speaker2 : Write this down because I'll forget this. So you took a maintenance fee of $35, so let me make sure I got this right. See 998. So wait a minute, it's still. See, I said I had 9900. And
Speaker1 : Your current amount. Wait a minute, I'm trying to.
Speaker2 : If you took out 35, I should still have 9948 instead of. oh, you said it's 9050 something. Tell me again, please.
Speaker1 : It's $9953 with $0.66. Okay, 995366. That's correct. Okay. For the maintenance fee. Okay. And that's in the rod. Yeah, that's the rod and otherwise for your traditional Ira. We have here 7000 $250 with $0.49
Speaker2 : 7000
Speaker1 : 200 $250, correct? with $0.49 that's in the non route. That's a traditional, traditional Ira.
Speaker2 : I don't know, traditional. Would that be called the non law?
Speaker1 : Wait, sorry, can you repeat your question? Would that be called the non rock? Yeah, I mean the difference is that the Roth Ira account has both tax money. And the traditional Ira has pre tax money. That's the difference of your both accounts. Okay, so the traditional has you said pre what? Now? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I have to keep asking the questions. The pre has what? Yeah, don't worry. Pre tax Pre tax money
Speaker2 : What does that mean by that? The traditional Ira. What does pre tax mean?
Speaker1 : That's For that At the time that you're going to pay for taxes, you have the option for paying for those. Paying for those money after, sorry, before the next tax season, you know, that's some tax implications. About your accounts. One is before taxes and the other one the raw rates, post taxes, after taxes.
Speaker2 : I guess I'm just understanding because you know the the maintenance the one the rock you said that was What tax is that? Just tell me the tax on that again, please.
Speaker1 : The taxes, it's just going to apply once you decide to withdraw this account or if you decide to roll over this account into another place, that's the scenario that the taxes will apply. But at this time you are not paying taxes for these accounts because these accounts are just. Right here with without doing nothing, you know, so. The accounts are just leave it alone. So yeah.
Speaker2 : Okay, let me, let me. It's very hard for me to understand what you're saying. I'm not meaning any harm, but now the actual one that you said. The one that has the $9953.66, that's the tax one. and the other ones are pre tax. What's the difference? If you tell me the difference again, I'll write this down because I was trying to write it down, but I missed. What's the difference between the Roth and the traditional?
Speaker1 : Traditional. as I said, it's the money who is pre tax. What means pre tax basically means that the money that you pay for that is deferred to to report your taxes for the next year. Otherwise for your Roth Ira, which is post tax money. Means that it's a money, that it's going to be paid after you pay for your taxes. So it's not required to pay for this year. Not it's gonna be paid for the next year just if you decide to withdraw this money or if you want to move this money into another financial company, it's just going to apply on those type of scenarios.
Speaker2 : So let me ask you this. So if I wanted to withdraw or get some money out of the Roth, could I do that or I can't?
Speaker1 : Sure, sure you can. Whichever account you want to withdraw, even if you want the traditional one or the rough one, you are able to do both of them.
Speaker2 : Okay, so I guess my next question is if just say I'm just going to throw some out here, just say I wanted to borrow, you know, $5000 from my 9900 5366.
Speaker1 : And that you said I'd be taxed on that, right? You say I'd be taxed on that Or is there a certain age where you know you don't get will be penalized or how does that work? If you Withdraw $5000 from your $9000. In that case, you will not be penalized because you are over the age of 59 and a half, Right? Yes, sir, I'm safe in that case. Exactly. So you will not be penalized. The penalties are just For people under the age of 59 and a half. And in this case, Tax The $9000 is post tax money, so. The taxes are already paid out, so remember for further information about taxes, it's better to get in touch with a financial advisor. He or she will explain you further. About tax implications because I'm not qualified to give you that and I don't want you, I don't want you to give you any FALSE expectation about it. Okay, I'm sorry. Go ahead. I'm sorry. Don't worry. Yes. As I said, it's just going to apply taxes, but how much taxes is uncertain. The most accurate way to see how much tax is going to be is by looking or by contacting with a financial advisor that you have. Okay, so can I just leave the money right here for right now? I've already been charged $35 a fee for this year, right? For this year, correct? The $35 were charged over May 19. So the next maintenance fee is going to be charged over May. 2026. Okay, so I'm going to call a financial advisor and I'll call you guys back tomorrow. All right.
Speaker2 : I probably can't get you back. You probably just have. you don't have one extension, do you?
Speaker1 : No, fortunately I don't have a specific extension for me, but you can ask for my name and but I mean, probably I will be in another call, but anyway, I can give you my name if you want it. Okay, I want your name.
Speaker2 : What's your name? Spell it for me because I can't. How do you spell it?
Speaker1 : Yeah, F as in Frank. A as in apple. B as in boy. I, as in India. A as in Apple, N as in net. Bab. Okay, that's cute. Okay, baby. Okay.

Speaker1 : Okay, Mrs. I want to know, do you know when the previous financial institution decided to roll over your account to us?
Speaker2 : I guess sometime in, I don't know, they sent me a letter stating I had 60 days to call them and I barely had the letter about a week and I called and I guess they already rolled it over so I'm not sure when they made that decision.
Speaker1 : Okay, thank you for that information. Why I'm asking this? Because the previous. Okay. So the rollover process to receive an account in spirals from a previous company will take. Several weeks will take a couple of weeks. So with that in mind, I'm going to start the search of your account with your information. So could you provide me at least 2 min on silent hold in order to search for your account?
Speaker2 : Okay, sure, that's fine. You want to fabric Okay. That Hello. Hello.

Speaker0 : Oh God.
Speaker1 : 2nd
Speaker2 : What was that, sir?
Speaker1 : Okay, for now, Mrs. I have to announce that with your information. We don't have an account with you yet, so in this case we have two options for you. So the 1st one. Just if you are comfortable, we are able to pull up an account using your full Social Security numbers. The 1st option, 2nd. As I mentioned before, this process is, it was a recent moment. It's really possible that we are in the process to receive your phone open and set up your account with us. Remember that you are going to receive a welcome letter from Inspired Financial. In the moment that your account is open with us.
Speaker2 : Okay, so once again, nobody can tell me because I don't even know the balance or what was taken out of my checks. I don't know what's going on. Once again, nobody can tell me anything like that. Correct. That's what you're saying. I have to wait until you guys, I guess, open up account. So. What is the purpose of you guys rolling over and opening up accounts if you guys can't even have access to any information?
Speaker1 : Well, as I mentioned before, we do not request for your account. Your previous employer. Yeah, and I didn't request for it either. So, you know, we're both in the same boat. For that reason also, I recommend that you get more information about this process with the previous company. To get The date, the exact date when they started with the process, roll off the account to us, the amount, and the method if they made a transaction, the transaction number or a check number with that information.
Speaker2 : But I just called the previous company and they said they couldn't give me any information because you guys have it. So who has the information?
Speaker1 : Yes, as I mentioned before, you need to request the information with the previous company for this one. What company?
Speaker2 : What company? Because I just called the previous company and they told me they didn't have any information because you guys had it. So what company do I call now?
Speaker1 : Okay, what is the previous financial institution who has your account?
Speaker2 : I don't know, I just got the letter and it said that they switched it to you. I don't know.
Speaker1 : I just want to help you out with this information.
Speaker2 : I know, but that's why I'm telling you. I don't know. I just received a letter in the mail stating that my 401 K was going to be shut down in 60 days. I called within the 60 day limit. I had only had the letter for about a week. It's my day off today. so I decided to call and they had already switched the funds over to you guys. I was told to call you guys that you guys would have information. Now you're telling me that account hasn't been opened up, that it's going to take a few weeks, but apparently they've had it in their hands for a year and a half, so I don't understand.
Speaker1 : Yes, as I mentioned before, this process could take several weeks. You are going to receive a notification from us. In this case, You need to reach out the company that sent to you the letter that you received to get that information that I told you to make a deep research here inspired to search for your account.
Speaker2 : They told me that they don't have any information that you guys had it because they rolled over to you. So do I? Do I need to get a hold of my previous employer? Who do I need to get a hold of?
Speaker1 : Yes. Please contact with them, but get this information. Maybe they do not have your account with you because they.
Speaker2 : The letter is from Transit. Get the fuck out of my way. The letters from Transamerica.
Speaker1 : Please contact North America to get this information. They should. Provide you with this information. To start with a deep search for this
Speaker2 : It was revised April 30. I guess. I don't know. They just told me that they didn't have. I don't know. They just told me that they didn't have any information that I need to call you. You' telling me I need to call them. I don't know who I need to call, but let's get this account set up because I guess I have money floating around and nobody can tell me how much it is.
Speaker1 : That case As I mentioned before, Once we receive your account, you are going to receive a notification from us, a welcome letter with instructions to claim your account.
Speaker2 : So what do we need to do to set it up, dude?
Speaker1 : For us for inspired financial. you are able to wait for the welcome letter. If you need more information, I recommend that you get. How are you going to send me a welcome letter, dude? You don't even know my fucking address. That's what I'm saying. A professional call. I just want to help you out with this process.
Speaker2 : Okay, so how are you going to send me a letter? You don't have my address, you don't have any information from me, you don't know what it is. So how are you sending me a letter? We are going to receive the information from the previous company, the old company that had your account. All the information that we need to send the welcome letter is there. We are going to receive the information from them and we are going to open your account and send you the welcome letter. I don't want to open account. I just want my money so I can be left alone. I don't understand what you guys don't. I don't get why we're bouncing around from account to account to account. I don't understand. So how long am I going to wait for this letter?
Speaker1 : Keep in mind that this process could take several weeks depending on the
Speaker2 : So I want a time limit, not several weeks. How long is it going to take?
Speaker1 : We do not have a time frame.
Speaker2 : Can you have a supervisor or somebody I could talk to?
Speaker1 : We are able to make a transfer call, just one.
Speaker2 : Alright, thank you. Go ahead and transfer me to that person. Let's see if I can get some more information out of them. Yes, I'm going to make the transfer calls.

Speaker2 : Sure be glad to Okay, my full social is 439. 25. 6939.
Speaker1 : Okay, it doesn't show me that I have any accounts here. Did the company say that they sent it to us?
Speaker2 : No, the company. Actually, I received a document in the mail from Social Security Administration. And it says that A company I worked for a number of years ago had a 401 k profit sharing plan. And It was last reported to the Irs back in 2004. That the account had a value of $54360. So this is. Came to us a little bit of a shock to me because I've forgotten all about it. But the company has since gone out of business. They sold the company off. Then I was told that It had initially been With a company called Great West and that. Supposedly Power had bought Great West out, but
Speaker1 : We did take over Great West accounts, but I don't have access to them. Maybe that's why it's saying that there is no account here. Give me one moment. Let me see if I have the phone number.
Speaker2 : Because it's so old. You know, nobody can seem to find anything on it, so. I would actually probably. Be happier to find out that this is all just a mistake so I can sleep tonight. One gentleman, I said, well, if it was only $360, I wouldn't worry anything about it. I'd blink my eye and move along. But being that it was reported to the Irs in 2004 that the account was valued at $54360. Of course, that makes you want to dig into it and say, well, where's this?
Speaker0 : Right. They migrate wars.
Speaker1 : There's a department that will handle that. I just need to find out. Who How to get you there. Do you mind if I place you on a brief hold? No, don't mind at all. Okay, thank you. One moment. Okay, I apologize about that. What was the full plan name?
Speaker2 : Full plan name.
Speaker1 : Does it say
Speaker2 : All I have is the company name. And it just says, Automated Imaging Systems Incorporated 401 k profit sharing plan. Original plan name, it says Automated Imaging Systems Incorporated 401.
Speaker1 : Okay, it doesn't say Great West life and annuity.
Speaker2 : It doesn't on the document that I got from Social Security.
Speaker1 : Okay, okay, give me one moment. Sorry, I'm still trying to look into it.
Speaker2 : Sure, take your time. I'm about to the end of my rabbit holes to even go down. So any efforts. That you do or you're kind of, we're getting down to the end here. I'm not too sure.
Speaker1 : Yeah, that's what I'm trying to figure out. Yeah, I. It's weird. Because Sometimes social securities will send you like stuff saying that. You have something, but we don't actually have anything. Now we do have a great West. County of Orange. Does that say anything like that on there? Okay. You may have to contact the Social Security office and let them know that you spoke with us and we're not able to locate the account. Because I don't show anything here. And then see if they're able to give you maybe a different phone number or maybe if it was sent to your state or something. because I don't show that we have an account here at all here for you.
Speaker2 : Okay, all right. Well, I do appreciate you digging through. Your vaults there to see if there's anything I'm just sitting here thinking, okay, well, because it's of the age that it's that it is nobody seems to. Real back and go back and see. But the document that I have shows that in 2004. Automated imaging reported to the Irs that there was $54360.
Speaker1 : You may have Yeah, and you may honestly have better luck with the. Irs, you may call the Irs and say, hey, I've already called X, Y, and Z and they don't have it. Did they send you a rollover 1099 form that shows it so you can send it or give me a copy so I can at least have some sort of like. Proof because if you have any money that gets rolled into another account. For instance, if it was that much in the 401 K and they moved it into an Ira, that company has to report it to the Irs because you're also supposed to report it to the Irs that the money was moved. You don't get penalized or anything, but you have to say, hey, this money is no longer in this account, it's over here. So you may have better luck finding it with the Irs and having them give you a copy of that 1099. So then you can take it and call whoever that company is and then kind of track it from there.
Speaker2 : Okay. All right, well, what number do I call to get a hold of the Irs? Do you know that?
Speaker1 : I don't know, you would just have to Google it. Google it and look it up. Okay, All right. well, I will do that. Jessica. Thank you so much for you, your time, and I appreciate you.

Speaker2 : Well, right now I'm just trying to. Find out where it is and have access to it. I don't know what I'm going to do with it yet.
Speaker3 : Right, Because once you have full access in the account, we do have four options that we can offer to you. 1st, you can cash out the money, but since the funds will go to you personally and not to another retirement account, so Irs taxes and penalties may apply, and for that you will receive a 1099 R form from us. 2nd option that you have is.
Speaker1 : You can roll over this account to your current employer. 3rd option is you can transfer this to a different Ira custodian if you do have. And the last option is to keep your account with us with an annual fee of $20. These options can be. Available online once the account
Speaker2 : Oh, I'm sorry, you cut out just a little bit, but I didn't hear all the options.
Speaker1 : Oh sorry, yes, 1st option sir. You can cash out the money. But since the funds will go to you personally and not to another retirement account, so higher risk taxes and penalties may apply. And for that you will receive a 1099 R form from us. 2nd option is
Speaker3 : You can roll over this account to your current employer if you want.
Speaker1 : 3rd option. If you do have like a different Ira custodian, you can transfer this account to them. Last option, you can keep your money with us. You can add money to it, but there's an annual fee of $20.

Speaker1 : So you mean you want to roll over this to your current employer?
Speaker4 : Yeah.
Speaker1 : Right, then let me go ahead and get your email address so I can send you the link.

My name is Anita here on the recorded line and may I have your 1st and last name please?
Speaker2 : Juliana Yost.
Speaker1 : Can you verify your date of birth and the last four of your social security number, please?
Speaker2 : September 9, 1985 and 0055.
Speaker1 : And the address we have on file for you as well as the name of the employer the retirement plan came from.
Speaker2 : 15703 Pet Mere Hill Road, Woodford, Virginia, 22580. and I' Orthopedic Specialty Clinic would have been rolled over and the best contact phone number for you. 577 and 1390 02:15
Speaker1 : And that's 577 139215. And how can I help?
Speaker2 : I'm trying to claim my account with you guys. When I try to go through the prompts online, I'm not getting anywhere.
Speaker1 : It does look like you actually did this already, so it's not going to let you reclaim it. You claim the account July 26, so you should just be able to sign into the account with the credentials. You provided. Can you verify your email address for me?
Speaker2 : Well, so the email I have, because my husband tried to log in for me and create it, and it said that he would get an email or that I would get an email within two days and I never received one. So the email that I have is Juliana Yost at m wh c.com.
Speaker1 : So that is the email address that we have for your username as well as what was placed on the account. If you have any other inspired web pages open, go ahead and close those out for me and I can send you the correct link to the portal here via email and then you would just sign in with that email address. Now, if you do not remember the password, go ahead and select the forgot password option. Otherwise, too many attempts, two or more, will lock the account and then you just have to wait the waiting period to unlock it. I did send that email to you. It will come from all of Ira customer support.
Speaker2 : The username is the exact same like with the email, web address and everything.
Speaker1 : The username is your 1st. Email address. you just verify the mhc.com email.
Speaker2 : Okay, so put in that because that's what I was like, what did you make my username? She's like, I don't remember. I'm like, well, it's asking me for both. Okay, so let me check that and then I should be able to log in from there and claim it. Well, it's already claimed, so now you should just be able to log into the account and decide on what you want to do. Yeah, if you want to just roll it over to another 401 K, you can do that on our website or you can withdraw it. Those are the only two actions other than reinvesting. Now, if you're looking to move this to another Ira, because this is an Ira, then you would just have the new custodian send us the transfer paperwork. We follow their request and send the funds directly to them. Okay, and with a withdrawal, withdrawing the funds, I imagine there's fees tied to that.
Speaker1 : Yeah, the only thing that's deducted or that we deduct is a $25 closing fee that comes out of the balance. Now, if you're looking to withdraw it for cash, Irs tax and penalty may apply if you're taking the distribution before the retirement age of 55 and a half, 59 and a half. But we don't like the penalty. We don't know what your penalty may be, if any, that is not withheld either. So like if you do plan to withdraw it, you would elect to have the taxes withheld or not. We don't withhold the taxes automatically.
Speaker2 : Okay, okay. Well, let me try again and log in. I appreciate.
Speaker1 : If you can log in before. We disconnect. I did send you the email. otherwise we'll have to send it another way here.
Speaker0 : Check my email.
Speaker2 : Okay, I see the email. So just click on the portal. Yes, the financial investment portal link. Now if I don't, he does not remember making a password. So that's. I also request
Speaker1 : Yeah, you would. If you don't remember, just selected forgot password option so we can send the reset link to you.
Speaker0 : Yeah.
Speaker2 : Alright, just give me a minute. I just went ahead and request the password reset and I got the email. so I'm going to do that now. Okay. Like anytime you make a password, write it down.
Speaker1 : I really don't Maybe Remember all of my passwords because we have so many for everything.
Speaker2 : Well now, so I'm trying to type in the new password box and it's not actually letting me type anything.
Speaker1 : So do you see where it says like kind of click here or is it like where it tells you to enter it? I've heard someone else say that. Are you doing this on your phone or desktop or laptop? I'm on my phone. Like if you click or tap there where it says in the box. Or is your phone creating a password for you or are you entering in manually? I tried entering my own and it won't type anything, but even when it says.
Speaker2 : To use a strong one, like nothing will come up. The security Policy has been disabled. Like if I try to If I try to create one. Yeah, it won't actually let me type anything in the password box.
Speaker1 : Can you press the, can you refresh on your device there and see if it will? Allow it to go through you like refresh and then you can enter in. Password It's kind of like almost not like a blank space, but if you tap in there or click in it, it should. Give you the info there.
Speaker2 : It might be in my phone if I click it. So I refreshed it and then I got a pop up that says all input is disabled, which I don't ever get that on my phone trying to put in passwords. Yeah, I still can't type in there. Do you have another device you could potentially try it on, Michelle? I can probably pull it up on my laptop. I just. Probably need to charge it because that's a Windows. Otherwise my husband is an Apple also. Yes, I can probably go see if I can log in on our laptop, but it might take me a few minutes to actually get on it. So I don't know if you want me to stay on the phone with you or not or just call back if I have issues.
Speaker1 : I mean, so if you have any difficulty doing so, you can give us a call back. I'm not sure. I mean, if you want me to stay with you to go make sure it goes through, I can, we do want to make sure you can at least sign in or reset the password. I do, because if you call back, it's going to be the same thing. It's totally up to you. However, if you don't have the time, you can give us a call back if it doesn't allow you to reset the password whenever you try.
Speaker2 : Okay. I will probably because I can almost guarantee that that laptop is dead so it's probably going to take it a few minutes before it will let me turn it on. So I don't want to tie up your time either. I'll try and I'll call back if I can't reset it and we'll just start from there on that on the laptop.

If you are trying to enter in like copy the code that it's sending to you, you have to manually type that code in when it sends you send it to you via text, and then you want to manually type in your password as well that you set up for the account. Do you remember the password? Yes, I believe so. Okay. Hold on. You said the end of this 1st paragraph. Correct. So it's just the Inspire financial investment portal right below the 1st paragraph there. It's loading Okay. Taking a while, but it's going
Speaker2 : All right. And so. Have you had the opportunity to put in your password yet or what is it that you're seeing?
Speaker1 : Here I remember telling me I should wait three days for something. I don't remember what ST.
Speaker2 : So the welcome email comes within three business days. Did you receive the welcome email yet? Because it does look like the account has been verified. Now, if you just did this today, you would have to wait at least 24 h to sign in.
Speaker1 : Oh, I did it.
Speaker2 : Okay, so then you should be able to access and sign into the account tomorrow after. So the account information does look like it has been verified here, but the welcome email, you may have not received that. And then you also want to make sure you verified your email with us because it does send you an email asking you to verify your information. Or to just verify the email address. But I do show, yes, you did just complete this today a little while ago. So I would just allow the timeframe for tomorrow for you to sign in. and you can use that same link that I sent to you to sign in. I can use the same one. All right. So I'm going to close it out so it doesn't fully populate. And then you say tomorrow I could touch the same one and use it. Yes. And then you would sign in with that username and password you created and then that will be it. You would be able to either roll your funds over, transfer them out, reinvest with Inspire, or. Transfer to another Ira. And so if you wanted to withdraw for cash, that's an option. And then anything resulting in it closing out, you do just have that $25 closing fee.
Speaker1 : Perfect. Thank you.
Speaker2 : You're welcome, no problem. And are there any other questions or concerns you'd have?
Speaker1 : And the funds that is in that account came only from all Mark Aviation.
Speaker2 : Yeah, this is only so if you had like multiple employers, then it would have multiple accounts here for different employers. But this one did come from Hallmark Aviation and it does look like Empower sent this to us September of 2024.
Speaker1 : Okay, but how would I know? I would have to call my Hr at the previous job to see what company they. Are using right
Speaker2 : Right. So it's like if you have another retirement plan elsewhere or with other companies, they always should send you a letter 60 days before. So if you separate and you don't tell them what to do with it, they are typically supposed to send you a letter letting you know that the account is moving over to someone else and then you would decide on what to do with it from there. But yes, if you need to know where it is and you would just call them and they should be able to tell you where it was sent to.

Can I put you on a brief hold while I look into your account? What Thank you, sir. It doesn't look like they have cleared all your information. So when you request for online access or distribution, we have to have everything verified. And so it looks like that that's what they're still in the process of doing. So. It usually takes about maybe anywhere from 24 to 48 h. To Follow back up with this. So I would give it about another 24 h being that this was. Started processing I am so sorry. They started processing on the The 28th and just, I'm sorry, on the 30th. So I would give it maybe like another 24 h or so business hours. So that is today is Wednesday. That would be maybe Friday. Give us a call back if you're still having trouble logging in. Now in the meantime, what you're going to look for is you're going to look for a email and you could also check your spam, but it's usually an email that comes that tells you to verify your email. Once that's verified. Then From there you Will click the link to the button to verify your email. And then after you verified your email, you will Get another email telling you to go ahead and log into the portal.
Speaker2 : But I used to be able to log in though.
Speaker1 : It doesn't show so. Maybe when we were Millennium Trust, but it doesn't show that there's online access in your account form. So it looks like you started this process on the 18th and the funding.

Speaker2 : I spoke to somebody yesterday who said that I needed to talk to. Talk to somebody In the back office or something and that I actually called back this morning.
Speaker1 : So I do see the notes in here. No, no, no, I see the notes in here that advise that. Explained that they need to call again in 48 h because the back office is checking your information. So I do see that in here. There Unfortunately though, because it's the accounts holding department, we don't transfer calls, we go by messages. So once everything has been updated, then they will confirm your information with an email. Now if you would like, I can put another service ticket in if you're having trouble. If you're having trouble logging in because. I don't see on here that your account has been claimed and once your account has officially been claimed. That process is what adds that online access. Because you're determining if you want online with mail, online with paper statements, it's specific things that questions that you have to answer. And once you've done that, then everything is scanned into our system. And I don't see that.
