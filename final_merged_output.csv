Speaker1 : I see. So you did not do that transaction? Yeah, there is. I'm looking online right now, 12345 transactions that were not, I did not make those purchases.

Speaker1 : Okay, so. I understand that this is Some sort of fraudulent activity in your account that you are not doing the transaction. So what I can do is I can call our debit card team and have your card replaced just to make sure that there won't be any other. Activities happening on your account and as well as I might transfer you over to them so that the fines will be reversed.
Speaker2 : Okay, like the that was. Yeah, because again. I've never used this card. Online. I've only used it in person because I'm looking at all my terms and I've only used it in person like at a. At an approved like retail for For health purchases only. So I don't even know how it got online.

Speaker4 : Yeah, a new card was shipped last week. This kind of just recently has been happening. Well, at least. Large transactions. I guess it had happened in January and I missed it. And they've been helping me. It looks like the charge got canceled that was trying to go through on the 23rd, but then this morning I went to check and I see one pending on the 29th for the same amount. So. I'm not sure how it keeps trying to go through anyway.

Speaker4 : Okay.

Speaker2 : Yeah, I just see it as long as copy. So just to clarify, I just see here on the card system that the latest one that they attempted was on the 24th and it is already declining because the status is already lost or a lost card and the amount was for 542. This has been reported. So.
Speaker1 : As for this 641 and $0.20.
Speaker3 : I will just A I didn't know about the 501, but yeah, I, I haven't used this card at all like. Whoever is using it is not me. I'm not planning to use it anytime soon. Hopefully so. Basically every charge is unauthorized.

Speaker1 : So I have recently retired. I received my emeriti. Medical card that gives me the ability to pay for the insurance here. And I'm wanting to pay with that debit card. Or with that card. Yeah, debit card. Is that something that I can set up with you here?
Speaker2 : So unfortunately, we do not take any type of cards at all. So The only way that we accept payment. Yeah, the only way that we accept payment is. Linked to directly to a bank account or by check or money order.
Speaker1 : Oh. Hm.
Speaker2 : Yeah. Is it like what type for the card itself? What type of an account is it coming from? Is it like an Hsa or Fsa?
Speaker1 : I believe so. It's called Emeriti Retirement Health.
Speaker2 : Okay, so what I would do if I were you, if you can reach directly out to that company. And see if Like I know like our so our kind of. Our Funding Accounts that we have Like, so if people have like like a retiree reimbursement account or anything like that. I know how it works on our side is if they do have benefits that they're paying through us also. They can do one of two things. They can either. Pull the payments directly from the account. Like set it up on our website for it to come out of the account or they can like pay out of pocket and get reimbursed. So because that is a different company, I'm not sure what their policies would be, but I would definitely reach out to them and kind of see what the best way is since we don't accept the actual card and see if maybe you can get reimbursed or if they can just set up the payments directly with like one of their agents.
Speaker1 : Okay. So My husband and I both retired at the same time. So I just wanted to make sure that like right now we still have health insurance, correct? That is that what it's showing or are we because. It says the last postmark date is 08:30, 2025. Is that correct?
Speaker2 : So I am showing that the payment is 08:30. 2025 is the last day to post market. The account I brought up is only showing for dental just so that you do know.

Speaker1 : Well, it doesn't mean that we decline them. It means that just because Amazon says that they're Fsa eligible, their system could be saying that it's not Fsa eligible. Let me take a look and see if I can see any declines. Yeah, it's coming from their system.
Speaker0 : Okay, let's see here. That's your card. And
Speaker1 : Your card is not active, that's why it's not approving it. Did you just get a new card sent to you? Let's see here. 465.

Speaker1 : In our system, it actually shows
Speaker2 : I called the number on the card and I activated it. Gotcha.
Speaker3 : I apologize. Evidently it did not go through. I'm going to put you on hold because our system does show that it's not active and it looks like all the declines are that same reason. So let me put you on a brief hold and call over to the debit card and. Let them take a look at it. I'll be right back with you.
Speaker1 : Mr. Hernandez, thank you so much for holding. Okay, so yes. You did activate your card because I see transactions in June and July where you've just recently used your card, but. They were explaining to me over in our debit card department is they've been. Experiencing an issue where some cards are getting switched back to non active. It's a glitch. They're working on that glitch. and evidently yours was one of those cards that it did that. So now your card is active while we're on the phone. If you want to try to go ahead and use it on Amazon, you go right ahead and I can let you know because it does show that the card is active now.
Speaker4 : Well, that's very inconvenient. and you should at least send an email, just like you send me emails about all the other transactions. You should let your customers know that you're having a glitch. Okay? This is very inconvenient, but thank you. Thank you for looking into it.

Well, it's it's listed as the address of Unisys Corporation, which is my old company, but the address under that is my current mailing address.

Speaker3 : Yeah. It's so weird because I don't see that. Let me look Some
Speaker1 : It was confusing at 1st and I thought we'd be okay, but then when I went to close it, it was going to mail it to the Co road address it's on. 865 idyllic place if you see it. If not, I can read that to you more slowly and we can just do it.

Took on the Cobra Insurance plan through my Employer and our employer doesn't have nothing to do it. So it's all up to me. but I'm guessing it's the same insurance that I had before.
Speaker1 : Cobra is the continuation of your insurance. Same insurance, same card.
Speaker2 : Yeah, and that's what I thought. I thought it was really, really simple, but this is probably the most difficult thing I ever had. It's like, this is a 4th or 5th call to you guys. Because you're the Cobra insurance provider and you're not getting the insurance. Through to the provider to clarify because I had a medical. Where I went in and I got denied everything because. Somebody didn't do their work. Then I finally got that taken care of a number of times. Then I went in to get my meds and I know this is the 3rd time I got denied picking up my meds and they put a, I talk to, you know, you people and they put a case number down where I got a case number where I'm supposed to be looking at and they said I was going to get a call back. I didn't get a call back and I don't. Yeah, nothing. And so I went in yesterday to get my meds again and I got denied again.
Speaker1 : Okay.
Speaker2 : And I got my card and everything here, you know, from. My continuation from my previous employee employer.
Speaker1 : Okay, so it looks like the prescription is not showing active. The medical part is Okay. Can I put you on a three to five minute hold and I will be right back?

Speaker1 : Okay, because we would not know that. And they never called. I've got a Number here We can call over there. And see if they're active because it says in the notes that. Your medical is shown active, it's the prescription showing inactive and it sounds like a rep. I'm sorry.
Speaker2 : I was wondering why, I mean. I've been active through medical and you know, all last year and all of a sudden I changed to cold and I'm inactive.
Speaker1 : Well, under a Cobra plan, it's a seven to ten day processing time for insurance to show active. But when you called in on the 22nd. Sun Rep. Has stated that your medical is shown active but the prescription is not. Yeah.
Speaker2 : I want it to be active like it should be.
Speaker1 : I know, I understand that, sir, but. The agent from Sun Rests was to give you a call back by the end of the day and they did not from what you're saying. So we can call over there if you would like. We're the 3rd party, so we send everything over to them and then it's up to the insurance to show active.
Speaker2 : Yeah. Yeah, give them a call and ask them why they're not.
Speaker1 : Okay. Do you have a few minutes we can call over there?

Speaker2 : Due to the plan years. So with the Irs guidelines, one of the guidelines that they have stated is that each year's funds can only be used to pay for dates of service that occurred within that plan year. And The run out time frame for the 2024 account was May 31 of 2025 to file any claims or anything like that to be reimbursed. So unfortunately, you wouldn't be able to use the 2025 funds to pay for the 2024 date of service. But you also would not be able to request reimbursement from the 2024 plan year.
Speaker1 : So the problem is that I would have paid this, but you guys have frozen my account. That was the main reason I could not pay my bills. To just give you an F. This has been an ongoing issue from since January. I got a letter that because something messed up on your side and I could not use my Fsa card.
Speaker2 : So looking at the transactions for the 2024 plan year, it looks like the account was zeroed out on October 30 with a $2.89 transaction. So the 2024 plan year had been completely depleted of funds on October 30 of 2024.
Speaker1 : So you're saying there was no any money left?
Speaker2 : Right, Yes, ma'am, for the date of service of November 5 of 2024.

Speaker2 : Is that Lori with an I or a Y?
Speaker1 : Laurie L A U R I E. Taft is T for Tango, A F for Foxtrot, T for Tango.
Speaker2 : Wonderful And then that zip code, please.
Speaker1 : Zip code is 30528.
Speaker2 : Cool. This might take just a moment while the system catches up.
Speaker1 : Thank you.
Speaker2 : Okay, it's coming up. Right. And then what are we doing for this member today?
Speaker0 : All right, so, so the account was fully verified.
Speaker1 : Her card was declined. The access indicator shows why for one of the. I guess The balance summary under Pfizer. But Under one of the other. and I don't know why there's two of them here. It doesn't really make sense to me, but one of them shows no and one of them shows yes. So only $158.86 went through, and I believe it's because that's how much was available in this current purse. But. She should have that full 220 06:58 available, but I don't know why the access indicator shows no. If you can help me figure this out, I'm not sure I understand.
Speaker2 : Yeah. I did see that there were multiple plan years within 2025, so they might have perhaps went on medical leave and came back, or maybe they left the company, came back, or something like that. But that might be why we see too. Let me take a look here though.
Speaker1 : Thank you.
Speaker2 : Oh yes. Okay, so it looks like there's an overpayment, so that should explain it. Let me see if I can find when that Rl went out though. Oh, they tried substantiating it and then it shove it into op. Okay, all right, so they have an overpayment. That's what causing it to be currently inactive.
Speaker1 : But she was too. okay, because I'm sorry.
Speaker2 : Yeah, I'm sorry, Josh, I'm not trying to interrupt. No, no, you're all good. I mean, with the overpayment. It should have declined both unless they were separate accounts. But I do believe that they were separate accounts. That's probably why one went through. it wasn't attached to the other account with the op. So that's probably why the 1st payment snuck through is that they had separated the accounts and then put them on the same card for whatever reason. And then one was an Op and the other wasn't. So that should explain why the 1st portion went through. but with it being in overpayment, we can't of course. Well, Let's check to see if they had a hardship maybe. Yeah, I don't think she's used her hardship this year so she could always submit for that. Most definitely it is under the $500, but yeah, it's declining because of the overpayments. Weird circumstances allowed the other one to go through though.
Speaker1 : So what I'm trying to say to you is that the overpayment should not be in place, and I'm working on it right now, but I submitted. A case earlier But she processed a refund back in June and that should have been applied towards the overpayment. and it looks like it never was. so I'm working on that. So she. Technically shouldn't have to ask for a hardship technically speaking, like the overpayment should be cleared by now. I'm just working on getting that cleared. Is there are anything I can do to avoid having to request a hardship that's not, you know, necessary in the 1st place or. Like, what should I do?
Speaker2 : Yes. I'm glad you mentioned the refund. Yeah, I see that listed in the system. Yeah, how bizarre. Okay, Yeah, since they refunded it, I'll turn it back on. Just one moment. Thank you.
Speaker1 : Thank you so much.
Speaker2 : Yeah, totally. But yeah, I'm sure you already have, but you know, if you haven't just, you know, send something off so someone can correct the op. Because that shouldn't be there any longer. Most definitely. How bizarre.
Speaker1 : Right. Sorry, I'm not trying to rush you at all. Is it going to take you a few more minutes? Should I go ahead and check on her?
Speaker2 : It should be a short Time It just my system's really. It's it's No, no, no, it's nothing either of us can do. You know, it's someone else's computer.
Speaker1 : Yeah.
Speaker2 : But hey, maybe they get us better equipment. These things work faster. Who knows? But aside from that, the card has been reactivated and they're all set to start using it.
Speaker1 : You're my hero, Josh. Thank you so much.

Speaker2 : I would have to actually get a credo. Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Speaker1 : No. You'll notice there are two other Transactions for the For around 18 hundred dollars that were canceled. So I'm just wondering, is this account going, is this going to be canceled as well?
Speaker2 : So that I would have to get a credo on the line for because their billing process is a little different from the express script side so that I am honestly not certain of. I can't see any like cancel transaction that you're referencing, but if it's coming from like a credo side, that would be why.

Speaker1 : Thank you. And are you the account holder?
Speaker2 : So I, I'm probably not in the system yet. I'm a new hire and I'm just like getting up to speed on all the benefits and picking my allocations But I had a quick. Question about what's actually covered in the commuter benefits that we have. And they just told me to call you guys directly, Lo.
Speaker1 : Okay, so what's covered in the commuter benefits? It's a pre tax program where funds come out of your payroll pre taxed and it covers transit. Which would be for bus, subway, train or ferry and parking. Right. So does that include.
Speaker2 : Sorry to cut you off. Does that include like if it's not Nj Transit? So like I take a more public bus system, but it's not, it's like through a 3rd party, like it's a commuter bus, but it's not like New Jersey Transit. Would that still be covered?
Speaker1 : You may Want to Because I mean, you can ask them if they accept the commuter prepaid master, if they accept commuter benefits through the employer. But I would not know. Do you know what the name of the bus system is?
Speaker2 : Yes, it's called Boxcar.
Speaker1 : Boxcar. I believe I had that before and that was not eligible because it was like a private. It was like a private. Company But they do accept They do accept our prepaid Mastercard. So we have what is called a prepaid Mastercard that. You can use to Pay for your services. And that's basically the bulk of the program. Is what it covers up to $325 per month for transit. It also has for parking at a parking lot, parking garage, or a parking meter.
Speaker2 : So are you saying it is eligible or it's not?
Speaker1 : For the boxcar, it would be with a prepaid Mac, it would be with a prepaid Mastercard.
Speaker2 : Okay, so as long as they will accept that.
Speaker1 : Right. As long as they accept the prepaid Mastercard. That would be eligible. Let's see here. Let me just check. I mean, you just put in a card to use the app, so I can't imagine you have restrictions on. I haven't. Yeah, I had this. Was for boxcars. So I had this last month. so I just pulled up my information here. I have sent over a ticket and. Okay. So yes. When I put a ticket in and the response I got back. Was that they do accept our prepaid Mastercard, which I would recommend is what it's stating. So they do accept what we have is a prepaid Mastercard. Those funds load to that card each month. It's not It's not a non contactless card. So you would either If they allow a swipe or if they have an app. Yeah, you do it right through the app. So I can just plug a card into that app and then it'll pull from that.
Speaker2 : Oh, wonderful. Okay, beautiful. That's great. Thank you so much. Oh, you're welcome. Anything else I can help you with today? No, that was it.
Speaker1 : All right. and Let's see. Okay, let me May I have Just so I can Note the account Do you have any accounts here with us?

Speaker2 : M. E E is in Elizabeth. Got it. Okay, so M. Mcgarry and then the number 2@gmail.com. Is that right?
Speaker1 : Okay, perfect. And let me take a look here at the plan and see where we are. So I show that you are still active on Delta Dental and your premiums are paid through. The end of the Cobra period, February 28 of 26.
Speaker2 : Okay, well I just wanted to double check because. Well, I got a call from a dental office that said I did not, that they did not see that I had coverage.
Speaker1 : So you are. Active still there has not been anything communicated To the contrary to the insurance company. What I would recommend is contact Delta Dental and make sure that they show you active and that you have the most recent group and plan number. Maybe they need to give you a new card. And sometimes that will resolve it. But if for some reason Delta doesn't show you active, please let us know and we will chase that down for you. But it still shows you active here.
Speaker2 : Okay, so I am paid up until February 28, 2026. Is that correct? Yes, ma'am. Okay, that's what I thought. But then I was looking through my records and I found a letter from you guys and I thought, gosh. Did I not respond? So Typically I haven't found that things change. From year to year with plan and group. And you're saying that could have changed with this new plan.
Speaker1 : I'm just guessing at what reason they would show you not active at the dentist office. So we want to confirm that Delta shows you active and why the dentist is being told that you're not. And the mismatch there could be that there's a change in your plan number, but to your point, they do usually remain the same.
Speaker2 : Yeah. Okay, well that's what, that's what I thought. I thought if you didn't, if you kind of continued on a plan, it was the same. I mean, since it was Cobra, I mean, I would assume it was the same as last year, but I was on Cobra last year. Oh, okay, here we go. I think I see what's going on. So you had a.
Speaker1 : Plan change letter that was mailed out to you on mid May. You know, the Delta Dental plan changed. It's still one Delta Dental. So maybe that's where the breakdown is. Maybe after June 30, they put you on a different plan number.
Speaker2 : Oh, okay, okay. Yeah, but unfortunately we don't have visibility to the plan details here, just the payment info. Yeah, okay. All right, so I'll contact Delta and let them and kind of find out what I need to do next. I think you're right. I might just have a different group and plan number.
Speaker1 : I'm wondering. I'm wondering, yeah, I'll go ahead. And not your account that we spoke. And if for whatever reason you need to reach back out, we'll, you know, if you let us know that Delta for some reason shows you inactive, let us know.
Speaker2 : Okay, all right. sounds good. All right. Thanks so much for your help. You're welcome.

Speaker2 : Like last year, right?
Speaker1 : Yes, 2024. Yeah. Can you offset over last year?
Speaker2 : Then I actually found a receipt already.

I get the mail for her and I see she's got these pieces of paper here, these slips of paper she's supposed to fill out and send it. I don't know if that's been done. I don't know if she's up to date on paying things.
Speaker2 : Understood. I understand. So I would be happy to look at things for you. I do need to verify some of her information. 1st, Could I have the last four of her social security number?

Speaker1 : 27 Ontario Drive, Chica, new York, 14225. All right.
Speaker2 : All right, just bear with me a moment. I'm still attempting to pull up the account. It's nothing other than my computer is being slow. Right. So without her verbal authorization, I can't go into a lot of details, but I can tell you what the account is about. So She doesn't have any payments due at the moment. This is basically. Covering her retirement medical as a surviving spouse. But that's basically all it is.
Speaker1 : Okay, now I know she used to fill out these slips of paper that she got. It was like just a whole bunch of them every month. You had to fill it out with a check. I think maybe what she did is she's got an automatic thing now where it's automatically taken out of her checking account because she's got a piece of paper here that said, how have to pay your premium, complete the enclosed electronic funds transfer form, an attached avoided check, and mail it to you and. Your account will be automatically charged. So it just automatically coming out of her checking account each month, then I don't have to send one of these in. That's what I was doing. We were filling these out every month and it got ridiculous. It was just like, you know, kind of hard to do every month filling out.
Speaker2 : No, it's set up on automatic payments now. Oh, thank God. Okay, All right. Yeah, she's in a nursing facility now. So, you know, I kind of got thrown into the mix here and.
Speaker1 : My brother was helping and he's no longer in the picture, so it's falling on my hands. All right, so I don't have to worry about all these slips of paper here. I was panicking.
Speaker2 : Yeah, those are just payment coupons so you can pay by check. It helps us match up the check to the.
Speaker1 : Okay, so the $70 just comes out every month automatically out of our checking account and it's paid. All right. That's good to know. Yeah, okay, I really appreciate the help on that. So all right, there's all these slips I can just. I guess throw them away. She's got a lot of them. I guess it's like for a whole year or something with them. They sent her so. Okay, well she look, I really appreciate your help. That makes me feel much better knowing that my mom's up to date on their insurance.
Speaker2 : Oh yeah, of course I was glad to be able to help. Did you have any other questions?
Speaker1 : No, I don't think so. That's it. And Sparta Financial Health, I guess that's it. That's not Aetna. Is it, was it used to be called Aetna or is that something completely different?
Speaker2 : All that we do is make making it possible for her to keep the coverage that she had with Edna. So we're more of an admin. But we just make it possible for her to keep that insurance coverage.

Speaker1 : What do you mean to use your funds? Yeah, it usually it carries over into like March one, but it'll be, I'm guessing it'll be gone before that for what I have left in 25.
Speaker2 : Yeah, so this year. The employer isn't doing the carryover. Doing what we call grace period. So the grace period is basically an extra two and a half months added on to your plan year.
Speaker1 : Which is what they did last year.
Speaker2 : Yeah, so you'll have until.
Speaker1 : March 15 to spend the funds. Yep. It's right there on the. Yeah, okay. Yeah. March 15. And then you'll have until the 31st to submit claims after the 15th. Yep. No worries. I don't have that much left in here at this point, so I'm sure it'll be gone by then. I'm not worried about it, but yeah, I want to, I definitely just want to get it paid so it can be reactivated.

Speaker2 : I know the physical year is about to end and. I have money left over my flexible spending account. I do have An appointment coming up to see my Dr., And I remember him telling me that I may need. Cataract surgery. But my question is And if I say, e.g., if my surgery was $2600 and I actually have. $1300 to spend As far as my flexible spending account. So that would leave me a balance of $1300. With the new physical year starting, would I be able to pay? That balance off with my new flexible spending account.
Speaker1 : So only if the surgery is happening in that plan year. So. Let me explain a little bit. So how it works is so you have a grace period which allows you to spend your funds until November the 15th of 2025 for this current fiscal year. So say, for instance, your surgery is September 1, September 2, you know, anytime after September 1. You'll be able to use your Last Funds and your current ones. But if the surgery is before September 1, you will only be able to use the current fiscal year spon.
Speaker2 : Okay, so what you're saying is best to wait till September to do any surgery and still be able to use that previous flexible spending account. Along with my current spending account.
Speaker1 : Correct.
Speaker2 : Okay. Okay. So I might do that because. Because as long as I have it done. That current Spending account before November the 15th.
Speaker1 : Correct.
Speaker2 : Okay. All right then, but let me ask you this. So if. E.g., if I went to the dentist, I mean, if I went to my eye, Dr., and if I just needed, if I just needed the glasses now. I And wait till September to have the Cataract surgery if I had to have it. Then would that be a continuation or that Or is this a new Procedure even though I went to The eye, Dr., and they had the exam and all that.
Speaker1 : Okay, so. I'm a little bit confused when you say continuation. So if you have a visit now or you know before September 1 and it's for glasses, then. That Would be fine, of course, to use your current funds for So are you asking as far as if. The surgery is a continuation of the initial appointment.
Speaker2 : Yeah, that wouldn't be the same, right?
Speaker1 : So no, so your date of service would technically be different because it's going to be based on the date of the surgery. And the date that you made the payment. So if the payment, as long as the payment is made after September, well, on September 1 or later, then you'll be fine.
Speaker2 : Okay, so basically what I could do is wait till September to make my appointment. And My Flexible spending account, I could still use that money along with my current money. Because I'm in a new physical year as long as I have that. Previous year $1300 used up before November 15.
Speaker1 : Correct.
Speaker2 : Okay, I think that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to call to reschedule my appointment for September.
Speaker1 : Okay. Okay, do you have any other questions for me? No, that's all I needed to know. Okay, not a problem. Well, thank you so much for calling. I hope you have a great day. Thank you. You too. Thank you.

I'm here also with In Spiral. How are you this afternoon?
Speaker2 : Good. How about yourself?
Speaker1 : I'm good sir. Thank you for asking. I heard you had some questions regarding your account.
Speaker2 : Yes, so. Basically all I want to do is to cancel my commuter benefits, to not have that money taken out of my paycheck. I'm just going to cancel my commuter benefits. And when I went to do that. Online, I had to set up my account because I'd never actually set up my account before. And it made me provide my inspired financial card number. And I did not have an inspired financial card yet. So last time I called, they said I couldn't have those benefits canceled over the phone without having my card number. And they couldn't give me my card number over the phone. So long story short, they made me. Order that card and have that card sent to me. And they said the card would be delivered within ten to 15 business days. And when I called was, it was June 12. So it's been, I think, like 30 something business days and I haven't received that card yet. But when I called it, I know I gave them the correct address and they gave it back to me and it was the correct address. So I just wanted to call to see if I could get those canceled over the phone or if not and if I had to have the card, if I could make sure that card is sent to the correct address again.
Speaker1 : Absolutely. Well, I'll be more than happy to assist you with that. Just bear with me for a few moments and let me take a look.
Speaker2 : No worries. Thank you.
Speaker1 : All right sir, thank you for holding. So it does look like, unfortunately, I am unable to cancel that benefit for you over the phone. It does look like you would have to either wait until you receive the card and do so on the portal or you can also maybe reach out to the benefit center with the employer who set up this account. We see that that's in pro. But it does look like that debit card was likely lost in the mail. So if you maybe wanted to go through the option with the portal, I can issue a replacement. And then it takes ten to 15 business days. So maybe while you're waiting for the card, you can also be reaching out to your benefit center.
Speaker2 : Perfect. Well, yeah, could you go ahead and get that replacement sent to. My current address. I don't know if last time I had a different address I just recently moved. Can you maybe just verify your address one more time for me please? Yes, it's 25. W as in West Randolph Street and that's Chicago, Illinois, 60601 and the apartment number is 20 309.
Speaker1 : It does look like we were just missing the apartment number, so I can get that added. That may be why it was lost in the mail. To get this updated in our system, you would also have to reach out to the benefit center for that. It means they didn't include that in the documents they provided when they collected this account.
Speaker2 : Okay, sounds good. Okay, but you can get that new card sent out then.
Speaker1 : Correct. Can you just confirm, I'm sorry, repeat the apartment number one more time.
Speaker2 : It's 23 092-309-2309. Okay, and can I place on hold for just three or 5 min to place that order for you? Of course, I appreciate it. No problem. Just one moment, please.
Speaker1 : Thank you again for holding sir. I really appreciate your patience. So your replacement card has been ordered to that verified address, including the unit number 20 309. You should receive it in about ten to 15 business days. Again, while we're waiting, I can recommend you reach out to your benefit center to get this address updated and also cancel your benefits.
Speaker2 : Perfect. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.
Speaker1 : Not a problem. Are you sure there's anything else I can assist you with since I had you?
Speaker2 : I guess just a quick question since. I had that commuter benefit, I believe I started that sometime in March, and it's been pulled out of my paycheck. So I think I have a couple hundred dollars for that commuter benefit in there, even once I cancel the benefit. Am I still able to use that? a couple hundred dollars because I haven't been using that. Can I still use that money even though it's no longer being taken out of my paycheck or is that a question for my benefits office, for my company?
Speaker1 : That would be a question for your benefits office because they may allow you to just submit for claims. If not, then once the benefit is canceled, the funds would just go back to the employer and then it's up to them whether they would refund that back to you.
Speaker2 : Okay, sounds good. Thank you. I appreciate it. No problem. Thank you for calling. Inspire Financial sir. Enjoy the rest of your day. Okay, you too.

Speaker3 : Thank you. One moment.
Speaker1 : Hello, Mr. De Salvo. Yes, thank you so much for patiently holding. Okay, so the way the subsidy works.
Speaker3 : Once you are enrolled, the subsidy automatically applies to your account, being that the account is still showing pending you, there's no benefits or anything listed. I won't be able to see if the subsidy was attached or not because there's nothing for the subsidy to be attached to if that makes sense.
Speaker2 : No, I don't understand that.
Speaker3 : Okay, so when you enroll, you pick your benefits, medical, dental, vision, whatever you want. So when you click submit, the subsidy automatically attaches to the account and it's going to show that it is for how many days, I mean, I'm sorry, how long they're paying for it and as well as. The amount that they're paying. So being that that you haven't enrolled that information we don't have right now.
Speaker2 : Okay, yeah, because they told me. They would walk me through the enrollment once the prices were changed from the $2040 for my wife and I. To the subsidy from Bosh Shalom. Uh huh.
Speaker3 : Yeah, it's possible if you were told in your packet that because this is just, you know. My experience, when you're told in your packet that they're paying for a subsidy, nine times out of ten it automatically updates on the account when you enroll. That way, it automatically attaches.
Speaker2 : Say that again.
Speaker3 : When they're, when the company is paying for the subsidy, the subsidy automatically applies to the account once the enrollment is complete.
Speaker2 : Oh, okay, okay. yes, sir. Yeah, but now I'm seeing here that you never enrolled or anything, so that's why we can't see the subsidy as of right now. Yeah, because they told me, don't enroll yet until the prices have changed and somebody was going to go ahead and walk me through that. I said call and we'll walk you through it. When we get
Speaker3 : Because the way I can see the subsidy is by clicking on your benefit. And being that there's no benefit here for me to click on because you never enrolled, I can't see that information.
Speaker2 : Okay. Is there? I know I talked to Astrid, I believe was her name. Yeah, and she said, yes, just give us a call. we can walk you through it and get you enrolled because they, I said, I don't want to click on anything and then lock it into the $2040 a month. For the two of us when the price should be a lot less than that. So I guess I I'll give y'all a call tomorrow. Maybe I can get a hold of Astrid and she can walk me through or she can get me somebody to walk me through it and enroll because I can't right now I'm not at the computer.
Speaker3 : Oh, okay. Yeah, I can assist you, but whenever you do get out of your computer, anyone that you speak with, if Astrid is not available, that's what we do as well. We can help you step by step with enrolling.
Speaker2 : Okay, great. Thank you.

Speaker2 : 12314 Shady Brook Drive, Pearland, texas, 77584.
Speaker1 : Thank you so much and I just need the last four digits of your flex debit card.
Speaker2 : 8577.
Speaker1 : All right, thank you for verifying that information. For security purposes, I've got your account pulled up here. How can I help you today?
Speaker2 : Yes, I went through the automated system to find out the account balance that I have and it showed a 06:28. And I wanted to ask, because I have to make elections for next year for coverage, Is there any carryover amount or are these funds gone once the new fiscal year starts or plans?
Speaker1 : So there isn't a carryover, but you do have a grace period. Which is basically an extension after your plan ends on August 31. That grace period ends on November 15. So you pretty much have until November 15 to use the balance that you currently have. And then November 16 is when your new balance from your new plan year would be taken out.
Speaker2 : Okay, would it be the same card or would I be expecting a new? Health care card? No, it would be the same card, which is good for five years and then we send out a replacement about a month before it expires. Okay, and it, is it something I could request because I had to add another dependent on to my coverage? Am I able to. Request additional cards or Yeah, absolutely. You can do that online or I can request those for you here if you.
Speaker0 : Let me see, did you already add them? You added the, I don't see it here. Okay, I can, if you have their social, I can go ahead and add them for you onto your flexible spending account as far as being able to be issued a debit card.
Speaker1 : Or again, you can do it online when you go into your account.
Speaker2 : Okay, I'll probably have to do it online because I don't remember their.
Speaker1 : Social
Speaker2 : I tried to log in, I guess, on the website and it said there were some issues to try later. Do you know if anybody's complained or. Mentioned any Website difficulties this morning.
Speaker1 : Not that I have heard of, but I'm actually showing that you don't have a username and password set up, so you may have had one with the previous administrator under Maestro, but I'm not showing that you have one set up under Us Inspire Financial. So. You may want to go ahead and do that at some point just so you have access to quickly check your balance, check your transactions, and of course be able to add the dependence as far as getting a debit card.
Speaker2 : Okay, okay, thank you. May I ask, does it list any eligible expenses that are. That we could use the funds for on the website. Absolutely. Yep. Let me just take a look.
Speaker1 : See what your plan covers here. Okay, yeah, so you've got over the counter, you've got prescription drugs, medical and vision, as well as dental and orthodontic. Specifics as far as over the counter, we do have a full list that's in alphabetical order. As far as with the eligible items. And then we also recommend going on to the Fsa store. So it's a website, fsa store.com. If you need to check out anything else as far as being able to kind of use up those funds before November 15, which is the last day for your grace period.
Speaker2 : Okay. Okay, well, thank you so much. I appreciate all the information. You're welcome, Michel. Is there anything else I can go over with you on the account? I still have you on the line. I don't think so. But I did want to ask, once I put in the request for additional cards, do you know typically how long that time frame is to receive?
Speaker1 : Absolutely. So that's about ten to 15 business days. We ship them out by regular mail. So it could come sooner, but we quote ten to 15 business days.
Speaker2 : Okay, all right. Well, thank you. You're welcome.

Speaker1 : No. What do you mean? I. yeah, I'm looking at it now, I think.
Speaker2 : Okay, if you have an online account set up, what you would do is. You would From the main screen. So you click home if you're on the main screen, you're going to scroll down. And you're going to look for View account details. It
Speaker1 : Okay, I see that. Yeah, I got it.
Speaker2 : Okay, and then when you click that, it should add it at the bottom. If you want to scroll down where all the links is, you should see a little link that says close Hsa.
Speaker1 : Let's see to do list expense manager. No, I don't see it. I'm looking at the balance and then the quick links. Is it in the quick links?
Speaker2 : Well, It should just be, do you see like a whole lot of links? It's just like view Hsa statement. And I know there's one that should say manage funds, but. Normally it should show like a little link that's, but if it's not showing, I've run into it before where it doesn't show. So if you don't see it. Then what you, the other, the other thing you could do is if you go to documents and forms and look under administrative forms and then just look for the Hsa closure for now the closure process takes. 14 days to close. There is a $25 closure fee that they would deduct from the balance and then they would just send you the funds once the accounts.
Speaker1 : Okay, I still under documents. I don't see the. To close it
Speaker2 : Did you go to administrative? Documents, administrative forms, and then you Should see you should scroll down on the forms and then you'll see the Hsa. It should just just the Hsa closer for that definitely should be on. Is that what it says? Oh yeah, okay.
Speaker1 : And then how do I do that? Can I fill it out right online?
Speaker2 : I don't know if it is. A form you can fill out. I guess it actually what it boils down to is you have that Adobe writer where you can type into the form. but if not, what you would do is, and I'm going to give you an email address that you can send it to.

Speaker2 : You can call me Jackie. Jackie. Okay. All right. How may I assist you today? Jackie? Okay, so I actually have just retired from my company, the Simpson Lumber Company, and. I've set myself up to do Cobra. And I've linked my bank account to my profile because I just want to go ahead and make my payment through that way. I have a question for you on that. So it says on here on my Hsa is to link a bank account to my Hsa. There is the only way for me to get my funds back to make my. Cobra Premium is my only way to get that back is through a check in the mail or can I get that deposited into my bank account? This link.
Speaker1 : I'm not understanding your question. Are you trying to link your bank account to your Hsa? It already is. I already have that done.
Speaker2 : So here's my question. I have to make my 1st payment and my payments due on August 1. So I actually just went in there to say, okay, I'm going to go ahead and make my payment. However, the system's wanting me to put, and I want to know if this is normal, the system is wanting me to put all my information in again. they are, which the system already has. Is that normal?
Speaker1 : Well, your Cobra account is totally different from your Hsa account.
Speaker2 : Okay, go ahead. Sorry, and I'm looking.
Speaker1 : Under their bank account information and I don't see any bank account here for you listed under Cobra.
Speaker2 : So I already got the approval. That it accepted it. So I guess That's okay. So that's really strange. So it had me enter all the information. So now you're saying I have to do it again.
Speaker1 : Through the Yes, because we don't work with Hsa. That's a totally different department.
Speaker2 : Okay, so let me ask you this. So. Is the only way and I don't know if you know the question or not. So if I make my payment online today, which I plan to. Is the only way for me to get my funds because Hsa pays for my Cobra premium. that is an acceptable coverage. is the only way for me to get my funds is for me to request funds and get a check mailed to me or can that be deposited into my account? If you look at my Hsa, you can see that my checking account is linked with my Hsa. That's what I'm trying to explain to you, Miss Jackie. I don't work in an Hsa department, so I don't have your Hsa information. So who am I talking to? I requested to talk to someone from Hsa. You're speaking with the Cobra department. Oh, well, they transferred to the wrong person then.
Speaker1 : Okay, well that's no problem. I can get you directly over.
Speaker2 : Okay, so hold on for a 2nd then. So. Okay, so. Do I have? Okay, so when I make my payment, am I going to have to go through the same thing, then again through the Cobra to set up my notification to link it with my bank account, which my bank account is already linked to my Hsa?
Speaker1 : That's what I'm trying to explain. So if you want to set up, if your Hsa is paying for your Cobra out of your Hsa account, your Hsa have to set that up through their system. But if you want to make your Cobra payment out of your own personal checking account and you want that to be like reoccurring, then yes ma'am, you will have to put your checking information under your Cobra account. Because those two are not linked together.
Speaker2 : Okay, so. Okay, so it sounds like that's what I have to do then. I don't think I need to be. I guess I. Yeah. It's so confusing. so. I thought That And you're Cobra right now and I want to make my account online is going to have, is it going to have me verify my bank account again just like it did with my Hsa? Because now I don't know why I have my bank account listed with my Hsa. I don't know if inspired can take it directly out of my Hsa to pay for Cobra.
Speaker1 : It is possible, but you will have to speak with the Hsa department so they can set that transaction up for you on a monthly basis from your Hsa balance. Okay, okay. That's what I'd like to do if you don't mind. That'd be awesome. Okay, let me just make sure if I transfer you over, you would like for your Cobra monthly balance to be paid out of your Hsa account, correct? Yes, that is correct. All right, which is something that can be done, but the Hsa department have to set that transaction up for you. Okay, okay, sounds good. All give me one moment. I'll transfer you directly over.

Speaker2 : And I did just double check it. It doesn't show that the card has been returned to us for any reason either. So it's been shipped to the address on file. So.

Speaker3 : Thank you so much. And how can I assist you today, Miss Goldman?
Speaker2 : My debit card has been suspended due to a charge that I have requested multiple times to receive information on what you received on it. And because my social security number has been incorrect until. July 10. I have not been able to get that information from you, so. Can you tell me where this card was charged at? What location? What's the date? Anything I know the is March 3.
Speaker3 : Okay, yes, it shows. Well, it looks like it was paid on the my chart, so I don't know if that was in person or online, but Duke Health my chart for $40 on March 3, that's all the only information we have from the transaction.
Speaker2 : Which is interesting because when I contacted Duke, they say they didn't receive a charge or a payment of $40.
Speaker3 : Did the payment go through on the my chart when you made the payment? Did they confirm it went through?
Speaker2 : As I said, they show they never received payment of $40. They don't know what A33 charges for from.
Speaker3 : Okay, so I understand that the provider is saying they didn't get it. Are you saying provider saying they didn't get it or?
Speaker2 : No one is showing record of receiving $40 from my Fsa card.
Speaker3 : Okay. I'm not really sure where to go from here. Well, that makes two of them. And I have almost $1000 being held.
Speaker2 : Because of this mystery $40 charge.
Speaker3 : So there's no money being held. Even if the card is suspended, you can still access the money there. You would just have to pay out of pocket and file a claim to get reimbursed.
Speaker2 : Yeah, which means my money is being held because you're not going to reimburse me until there's some 40. This mystery is solved and it's frustrating because I have sent four faxes asking for this information and no one's replied to me.
Speaker3 : You send faxes asking us for the information.
Speaker2 : Yeah, no one has returned my phone call. No one has replied back to me at all with any of this information.
Speaker3 : I'm sorry. Yeah. But yeah, as far as all we know is the card was used on the my chart for Duke Health for $40 on March 3. Our system is not going to produce any other information.
Speaker2 : Why has nobody contacted me back when I've repeatedly sent faxes requesting for information, the last one being July 21?
Speaker3 : So I can't answer that. I don't know who responds to the faxes. Apparently no.
Speaker2 : Terrible customer service So now I'm stuck in the middle here. And I have a car, I have almost $1000 I cannot use because you guys are holding it up for something that I have no idea what it is and my doctor's office doesn't know what it is. So what am I supposed to do?
Speaker3 : Okay, so some other options would be if you have any. Expenses that you've paid out of pocket for, you can file a claim and offset the $40 or you can pay back the $40 to the account to get the. So either way, you want me to pay for something that I don't even know what it's for. So how can I pay for something if I don't even know what it's for? How do you know that somebody can take my card and charge it someplace else for someone else?
Speaker2 : But I'm being responsible for this mystery. $40, a lousy $40 you want me to pay for when I don't even know what it is.
Speaker3 : Well, clearly it's a payment for a health service that Duke Health provided. Well, clearly doesn't have a.
Speaker2 : It
Speaker1 : Okay, well.

Speaker2 : Right. Well, I'd be happy to look at that for you. I'm still trying to pull up your account. I apologize. My computer is running a little slowly. It'll be just another moment.
Speaker0 : Oh.
Speaker2 : All right, so is your account ending, you've had the entire 18 months, or is Coca Cola just not paying past a certain point?
Speaker1 : Yeah, I think they were covering up until. It was six months, so I think they were covering it up until 10 August.
Speaker2 : Okay, all right. so there's a couple of things here. So if you decide that you want to terminate the coverage after they stop paying for it in part or all. We can have you send us an email to terminate coverage or you can continue the coverage and pay for it all the entire premium yourself. Or if that's going to be too much money for you, going back again to terminating the coverage. What I recommend people do is check out the healthcare Dot Gov marketplace for something with a better rate.
Speaker1 : And so What would be the monthly cost?
Speaker2 : Well, I'm still trying to get your information to pull up and it turned out that there were so many Christopher Smiths in our system that it wasn't finding you. Would it be Actually, bear with me one moment. I apologize. I'm trying something else. There we go. Okay. All right, so right now. The medical alone, if you were paying for it yourself, is $2314.45 per month.
Speaker1 : Okay.
Speaker2 : And that's just for the medical.
Speaker1 : That's just for medical Okay. Oh, and the dental actually, I'm looking at my paperwork now because I was trying to, it looks like the dental is 127.
Speaker2 : That's what I have as well. 2730. That would be 20 400 a month.
Speaker1 : Okay, and so. What do you want me to ask her? I already told you the date. So are you able to. Send me An email On that or is that that my coverage is ending because my wife has the option to get health insurance through her company but she needs a letter. With a Verifying when our coverage ends or can I just use my. I don't know if I could use this. Paperwork I got originally from the company, but.
Speaker2 : Right. So it looks like your coverage isn't actually ending until August 10 of 2026, Not this year. Now I know that there is a date that Coca Cola is paying up through, which is August 1 of this year. But that's the difference is it's not ending. It's just if you want to continue paying for it yourself.
Speaker1 : Okay, so I'll have to use my severance paperwork then because it specifies the August 10 date. All right, All right. Fair enough. Was there anything else I could answer for you today, Mr.?

Speaker1 : So for this Hsa account, I don't think that the account holder has. A profile on the website, it doesn't show that they have created an account online.
Speaker2 : Okay.
Speaker1 : So Yes. We just made
Speaker2 : Like just To make the account this weekend. And it's asking for a verification code. is it possibly because. We haven't done the verification yet. Is that why it's not saying that there's not an account?
Speaker1 : No, because when you create an account, it has to create all the way and you into the account, if you did not finish and it didn't take you into the account, it would not create an account. So you have to do all the way until it takes you into the account. So we did as far as it would let us. and then it said, okay, log in. And we tried to log in and it said, okay, we need a verification code. And that's where we got stuck. No. We have to start over and create a new account if you're able to. I can guide you through to make sure your account is created online.
Speaker2 : Perfect. I mean, I can do that. My little one might come in and out of the room.
Speaker1 : And do you have the member with you to give you content?
Speaker2 : He's at work at the moment.
Speaker1 : Oh, okay, Because they need to give consent. I don't see you on this account as an authorized representative for that. So if you have them on the line, if they give a consent, we will be able to guide you through the website.
Speaker2 : Is there a link that you can send to the email on file and he can do it and then he can just give me the information.
Speaker1 : No. There's no link for that. No.
Speaker2 : Okay, how late are you guys open?
Speaker1 : Until 07:00 p.m., central time. Okay, perfect.
Speaker2 : Then I will give you guys a call back as soon as he gets home from work and we'll. Get this taken care of. All right, ma'am. Any other questions? Nope, that was it. Okay. All right, thank you for calling.

Speaker2 : I don't know if the code was wrong. But I keep getting registration information you admitted or submitted is not valid every time I try and.
Speaker1 : Okay, let me see if I can help you do it. Let's see if you and me can get it done. Are you in front of your computer?
Speaker2 : Yep.
Speaker1 : Okay, did you go to Cobra benefits.com? Yep, my new registration. What have you got for your registration code?
Speaker2 : Lowercase b, lowercase b, capital X, capital Q. Small V, small M. A Y
Speaker1 : Capital a small Y. Yep. Okay, so go ahead and type that into your registration for the registration code. I did, everything's already in. All right, and did you check the little box at the bottom? It says I'm not a robot. Yep. Okay.
Speaker2 : There's a green check next to the registration code, but none of the other boxes have a. Green check and you put your social security number in. Everything's in. Phone number, social individual Id.
Speaker1 : Take your individual Id out. You don't have to put that in there.
Speaker2 : It's one of the things to put in.
Speaker1 : Okay, and you don't have to put your phone number in either if you don't want to, but if you want to, you can leave it in there. That's fine. All right, that one's going now. it's going through. Okay. Now what's it asking for? Now it's setting up the username and password and everything. Okay, perfect. Now once you get that done, the username can be anything you want and the A password can be anything you want, but the password has to be at least. Eight characters and it has to have one capital letter, one small letter, a number, and a special character.
Speaker2 : Okay, why does it ask for individual Id number if that's what's going to default it out of there?
Speaker1 : That's why it says not required. It's optional. I'm not sure.
Speaker2 : Just individual Id, but yeah.
Speaker1 : When we help people sign up, we tell them, don't put the individual Id in. I don't know if it's because. It's got the same amount of numbers of the Social Security number and so it throws it off.
Speaker2 : Okay. That should do it then.
Speaker1 : Okay, now just before I let you go, just let you know once you get your username and password set up. It's going to have you log in again. So the next time you're going to want to log in with your username and register username and password on the members administrator side. And it will say code, it will say send validation code. It won't let you log in until you send validation codes. Go to your email, click the link. Then it'll take you back, you'll sign in again, and then you'll be in.
Speaker2 : Okay.
Speaker1 : Okay.

Speaker2 : You said 34353588. 3588. Thank you for that. And on which account were you calling it about today? Was it the Fsa or dependent care account?
Speaker1 : I'm just calling. I have no. Honestly, I mean, I'm just a guy that moved from Europe to America, right? So there are many things that I just don't know. I called for two things. One, to activate this card that I have here that apparently is still not active.
Speaker2 : I'm sorry, I could barely hear you say it one more time.
Speaker1 : The 1st thing that I call is to activate this card, this debit card that I received that is still not activated.
Speaker2 : Okay, you want to activate your debit card today And also if I can use with my account to pay a visit of my son or it's only for me, that's the question. So you can pay for visits for your children as well.
Speaker1 : With this card so I can use it now, I can activate it and I can already pay a visit or how does it work?
Speaker2 : So it looks like for the Fsa you do have $250 available to use, so you can go ahead and swipe for that. Me just make sure it is No blocks or anything. One moment.
Speaker1 : So the visit is not for me, it's for my son.
Speaker2 : That's fine. You can use it for your children as well as your spouse if you have one as well.
Speaker1 : Okay, so basically now I can. Give the details of this card. To the pediatrician and they charge it and that's it. Does it work this way?
Speaker2 : I'm sorry, on the 5th.
Speaker1 : So I have a visit, my son has a visit with a pediatrician in a couple of weeks. Right and These guys charge me, I don't know, $140, something like that. My question is, can I provide them this card that you just activated?
Speaker2 : I haven't activated the car yet. I'll have to place you on hold to get that done. But once it's activated, you can go ahead and get that used. I do see you have until November 30. Go ahead and submit any documents and everything for your son or yourself or whatever.
Speaker1 : The question is, should they use this card to pay or should I send you documents through to get a refund? That's the way that I don't understand how it works, this thing. Again, I'm sorry, stupid question, but I just moved from Europe and we don't have these things. That's why I called to ask.
Speaker2 : No problem. So just to make sure I understand. You're trying to make sure that you can swipe the card for the visit for the pediatrician, correct?
Speaker1 : Correct. correct.
Speaker2 : Once I activate, I won't activate it, but once our debit card team activates, the card is good for use and you can also use it. Well, can I place you on a quick repo just while we get to activate and then we can go from there? Sure, sure.
Speaker1 : Hello.
Speaker2 : Thank you for holding so I was able to go ahead and speak to one of our representatives. The debit card team to get that card activated for you. The last four digits will be the Pin number. The 3588 will be the Pin number to use if you do go ahead and use it today.
Speaker1 : Okay, good. So basically my card is active and now I can use it. Correct. Good. And the question why I got confused before is that if I go to my account, I see that I have a child care dependent account and a child dependent account. And my account, that's why I was asking if I use this 250 to pay for my son visit or not because the visit is for him, it's not for me. That was confused me.
Speaker2 : I'm sorry, can you say the question one more time?
Speaker1 : So the question You already addressed the question before. That I can use it to pay even for my spouse and even for my son, correct?
Speaker2 : Correct.
Speaker1 : Good So as of today, I can use it basically.
Speaker2 : Correct, the card is good for use now.
Speaker1 : And then the pin is the last four digits. Very good, thanks.
Speaker2 : It anything else you wanted to check or confirm that the account was it just that?
Speaker1 : No, I think that that's all. We're all set. Thank you.
Speaker2 : No problem. I guess if it wasn't anything else, you try to enjoy the rest of your day. and thank you for calling your Ut Flex provided with Inspired.

From here in the payment method. I'm, I'm just going to change this to the payment method that you have used.

Speaker1 : That's fine. You should have this number on file, but 757-593-0139.
Speaker2 : Okay, thank you for that. And how can I assist you today, Mr.? Docker?
Speaker1 : Yeah, I'm trying to figure out. I had talked to somebody there. There were a number of. Of things on my last year's plan. That were messed up. And so I sent an Eob for a large bill that's still due. And And they were supposed to offset those things. and it looks like they did because they sent me a small payment after that. But I couldn't quite tell what that situation was. And so. I just tried to order some prescription glasses and it rejected my card. So I'm trying to figure out what's going on.
Speaker2 : Okay, let me take a look here.
Speaker1 : I had sent all the documentation for some things that were that. For whatever reason, they didn't get kind of automatically cleared through you guys. But some of those things, I don't know what, if they didn't like what I sent to them or what the situation was. So when I talked to the lady last time, I had a couple larger bills that were. Unpaid and one of them was I sent the Eob emailed a Pdf of that and I thought all this was straight, so.
Speaker2 : Okay, let me see. So looking at the claims for last year. I'm sorry, do you mind if I place you on hold, Mr.? Dear?
Speaker1 : Oh yeah, that's fine. Thank you.
Speaker2 : Hello, Mr. Duck.
Speaker1 : Yes, ma'am.
Speaker2 : Thank you for holding. I apologize for that. Wait, excuse me. So I'm not seeing any issues with anything for 2024. Your card is still on. On it's not suspended. And so when I look at the decline for your purchase, the code, the decline reason is suggesting either you used it. At a merchant that doesn't have an Iia system. Their payer system. Isn't a Iia system or you are purchasing something that's ineligible and it looks like it was an optical website.
Speaker1 : Yeah, it was that particular brand. It's their prescription sunglasses. I wear prescription lenses, so. I know that prescription glasses are covered. Right.
Speaker2 : So then in that case, then it would probably be more so the fact that the payer system that that website uses is not recognizing. Or is not Using a system that recognizes the Fsa card. So in that case, you would need to file that claim manually for reimbursement.
Speaker1 : Okay, so my my cards fine and I can I can use that it's not suspended or frozen anymore Everything's straight with all that And all I need to, but. I just have to use some other payment source for that and then submit it to you guys as a reimbursement thing.
Speaker2 : Yes, sir. Yes, sir. All right, fantastic. Thank you so much. I appreciate your time. You're very welcome. Thank you for calling Inspire Financial. And I also just wanted to make sure I let you know some information. You still have $60.79 left on your prior plan year, and so you can still file claims against that up until September 30.

Speaker2 : You sent to a light specialist. However, the Eob still shows the claim is pending. The Eob submitted says the insurance is still waiting on the account holder to provide. Or the provider to submit more details. So they're probably waiting for the provider to submit some more information.
Speaker1 : The provider Yeah, but they had at 1st I sent from the doctor's office, but then they asked me for my. Dental insurance. my insurance. And so that's what I. Sent yesterday
Speaker4 : Not sure. Whatever else

Speaker1 : Because at 1st I sent it from the doctor's dentist's office and then they wanted it from the insurance company. So yesterday we tried, but she was on the phone with me. It didn't work and she says you only get one chance. So then she gave me her email and everything and so I can email it and that's what I did. So We'll see. I don't know if you all reach out or.
Speaker4 : Oh.
Speaker5 : Let me see.
Speaker1 : I mean, it's still early. We're not able to find yet.
Speaker0 : Ah.
Speaker5 : Okay, so on here there shows on the Ab sent in, there is a claim remark, general remarks, and says, and I'm going to zoom in because I need to be able to see this. In certain states, Ppo dentists are not required to accept a patient Ppo discounted rates for non covered services. One, we asked you or your provider for more details, but we did not receive them. We need the information before we can fully review the claim.
Speaker2 : So this is from your insurance provider.
Speaker1 : Okay.
Speaker5 : I would get in contact with Edna.
Speaker2 : Let's see here.

Speaker2 : We were looking for substantiation. You're in kind of a different. Situation Because If you were still employed by the state. Your card would have been temporarily deactivated until we got the information that we needed to substantiate these charges to see what your patient responsibility was, stuff like that. But since. You're no longer employed, it really doesn't have any effect on you necessarily unless you were to go back and get another Fsa. With the state. You know what I mean?
Speaker1 : It does Thing Is that I do have Like $900 left in there that I think I can still use. right.
Speaker2 : Look You You can still use it, but all charges. All dates of service would have to have been. Basically On or before November 1 of last year.
Speaker1 : Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker2 : Yeah, you can still submit claims online and get reimbursed. Just because we're looking for substantiation for those charges doesn't mean it actually lock the entire account.
Speaker1 : Okay, okay. And then. So I have a question. We've just like very Unexpectedly, because we have not seen this bill before, we just got an extremely high bill from a hospital, but the date of service was October 23, 2023. Can I use it for that? I mean, I was employed and I have it. No, it has to be this past year.

Speaker2 : Yes, and also we do. Yes, that's correct. Mr., Ross and I do apologize to cut you off. And also your account was set up for an auto pay, which means that.

Speaker2 : A notice today in the mail that this was my text card had been suspended because I didn't. I guess show proof of a bill from 327, but this was my 1st time receiving one of these.
Speaker1 : Really? Yeah, the other ones are generally sent via email. Yes. Oh.
Speaker2 : Okay, that's why. Okay, I probably didn't. Okay. So What are you needing? Just a receipt from the doctor's office.
Speaker1 : Actually, we need something a little more detailed. We need something with five pieces of information on it, which would be the provider's name, patient's name, the date of service, not the date of payment, what services were provided in the total cost. And if you're unable to get that from the provider, if it was put through your insurance, you can always reach out to your insurance and submit a copy of the explanation of benefits. Okay, okay.
Speaker2 : Because it has It's just a payment receipt, but it has. The department's name, but you need something with the address of the department.
Speaker1 : Not so much the address, just the name of the provider.
Speaker2 : Okay. Okay. It has, well, I'm just, it has Texas Ob Gyn specialist. It has my account number. My name The date I went and then it has. The appointment admin date on here, the type of service, I guess the source. The card number and the payment amount. ST.
Speaker1 : Okay, so that. It is listing the services that were provided, correct?
Speaker2 : Well, it just says e visit copay. Should I reach out to the doctor's office to get something more? Detailed
Speaker1 : I think I would just to be on the safe side. Because Basically, you don't want, when you're submitting something, the last thing you want, especially when your card is suspended, is anything to delay getting it. Reactivated. Yeah, because I have
Speaker2 : Another doctor's appointment on Thursday.
Speaker1 : Wow. well. My advice is if you have to pay out of pocket for that appointment. Get a copy of the invoice and go ahead to your online account and submit it for reimbursement because we will reimburse you for that. but make sure you wait until such time as this particular. Expense has been cleared because otherwise the reimbursement will go towards that overpayment. Okay.
Speaker2 : Okay, do you see anything else that you guys may need a receipt for while I'm. On here
Speaker1 : Let me go ahead and check here. Going all the way back to the beginning of this current plan year. No, I don't see anything. But let me go back just a little further here.

Hi, Mr. Weir, My name is Lisa with the Usps dedicated team. I hope you're well today.
Speaker1 : Thank you as well.
Speaker2 : Thank you. So I understand you're having trouble logging into the account. I do need to verify two small pieces of information before we continue. If you could just provide the mailing address that we have on file.
Speaker1 : Should be 9228 Germania Street, Philadelphia, Pa 9114. Thank you. And the last four digits on that Inspire financial debit card. 5429. All right, how can I help out today? Okay, so I was trying to log on. In spirit because I'm just the app itself wasn't letting me get to authorized products. For purchase So I decided to try and log on to the website. But the saved password I had doesn't seem to work and I got locked out of the account that I had to call and get it unlocked. Now I did change the password just now. And it told me I had to log on through light blue.
Speaker2 : That is correct. Unfortunately, going directly to Inspire final.com would not work for you guys. Being Usps has specific security in place basically. Once you log in, light blue at the top, you should see a tab that's labeled Apps. If you're on a mobile phone, you're going to have to look under the menu, which is the three lines on the left, to find employee applications. But there, once you're in there, you'll see flexible spending account and when you click on that, it re routes to our website. So if you're accessing it outside of the mobile application, it does have to be done through.
Speaker1 : Okay, yeah, no, I just found it and I got the oak to verify so I can do that.
Speaker2 : Okay.
Speaker1 : So I shouldn't be locked out then.
Speaker2 : I'm not showing you as locked out. No.
Speaker1 : Okay. All right, well then I'll. I gotta get the oak to SE. Make sure I can get in. I was going to say let me wait with you while you try and access the account just in case. I do appreciate it. So I'm not getting a push notification from them. Let me see if I can.
Speaker0 : What
Speaker2 : Is it light blue that's giving the issue or our website?
Speaker1 : So it's apparently oak to verify. I don't have. Inspired or the Fsa in there. That doesn't work off of the light blue code, correct?
Speaker2 : No, it would actually send you a separate code, typically if you're logging into our website.
Speaker1 : Okay. Right. Yeah, I don't see where I'm.
Speaker2 : So when you clicked on flexible spending account within light blue, what is it giving you?
Speaker1 : So it brings up the Sign with your account to Fsa, verify it's you with a security method and it has my Ace Id and it says select from the following options. It's either enter a code from Oak to verify or get a push notification from Oak to verify.
Speaker2 : Okay, so you probably have to select one of those options and continue.
Speaker1 : Right. I've tried them both and it just waits for the code. Yeah. Push notifications don't come through and The code I don't know because I open up my Ok to Verify app. But I don't seem to see anything about flexible spending account in Spa, any of that stuff.
Speaker2 : Okay, so it sounds like that might be an oak to verify issue. Not necessarily our website.
Speaker1 : Right. So if I try to add. If I try to add this to the oak to verify, it tells me to scan the Qr code, but there's no Qr code to scan on the website.
Speaker2 : Okay, let me place you on a brief hold and do a bit of research. It shouldn't be much more than about three to 5 min.
Speaker1 : Okay, thank you. Thank you.
Speaker0 : Okay, thank you very much for your patience. I definitely appreciate it and I apologize for the lengthy hold on that.
Speaker2 : Given that it's an issue with the multi factor authentication, you may want to reach back out to Hr shared services or possibly Opm because that's something that we unfortunately do not have any control over.
Speaker1 : Okay. All right, yeah, because it's not giving me any options. It's just saying to verify, I can either enter a code or. Or get a push notification. but when I click on either one, it does nothing and there's no other option other than those two. So. So
Speaker2 : Yeah, I was going to say I definitely would reach back out to Hr, shared services or possibly Opm only on the grounds of the information that we have does indicate that you have multi factor authentication, but it doesn't give anything else beyond that.
Speaker1 : Gotcha. Okay, well I appreciate your help and I'll give that a shot. Thank you so much. All right, you're welcome. You have a great evening. Now you do the same. Bye.

Oh, I'd be more than happy to check the accounts with you here. So I was able to pull up the flexible spending account or Fsa. and this is gonna, I mean, we are currently in the 2025 plan year, although your account started March 29 of this year. And this really shows Although there is an election amount of $1000, it seems that you already have consumed the full. Amount because this is really showing zero balance. Let me take a look though on the transactions. Let's see, because supposedly that $1000. Can be used up until the end of the year, which is December 31 of 2025, although if unused, there is even a carryover amount maximum of $640. But yeah, I can see that you also have. Set up your account online because you should be able to access your Fsa or check even whatever transactions since you are having inquiry with regards to your balance. But yeah, this is already now ma'am showing a zero balance.
Speaker1 : Okay, I'll just check the thing. I'm not understanding. Okay, thank you. So when they send me those reimbursement checks, that comes out of the two.
Speaker2 : I'm so sorry. What is it? The very last.
Speaker1 : Like when you get a reimbursement check, like if I go, like I got a check yesterday for $112, they come out of the, well, maybe I was letting you go.
Speaker0 : Does that come out of the
Speaker1 : No, I was talking to somebody driving. I don't know the DR. Does that come out of the balance?
Speaker2 : That is correct. So yeah, as I can see here, the very last check that we have processed. Was just that today for $46.17. So after that your balance went down to zero.
Speaker1 : Oh, because I got a check the other day for 01:12.
Speaker2 : I apologize. Go ahead.
Speaker1 : So what makes them send those checks out? Because I never requested them, so I never understood how they came.
Speaker2 : Oh, okay, I see. Well, it seems that. I mean, if you're not aware, this is an automatic submission whenever you go to a specific provider, let's say, e.g., using your insurance. Automatically an information is sent to us for any expenses paid out of pocket. Alright, so that's the reason why. A claim is submitted to us and once it is approved, a check or a reimbursement is being processed. So it's up to you on how the payment is being processed. Let's say, e.g., a doctor's visit or a hospital. Bill that you need to pay or that you already had paid. So this is an automatic. Claim submission. Yes, and I appreciate that you have checked this with us, but I just want to make sure miss Cole, are you having trouble logging in online or are you able to get into the website?
Speaker1 : No, I'm able to get into it. I just didn't know how it works. I didn't understand.

Speaker1 : My account Uh, I can use my card so I try to use it. I don't know how Can you check that?
Speaker2 : Okay, so the card was giving you trouble? Yes. Okay, so what I'm actually seeing here when I'm looking at the account is the card may actually be temporarily suspended and that is just due to two transactions that it looks like we're requesting documentation for to get the charges essentially validated. And we would have sent letters, but it's okay if you miss those, that sometimes does happen. The two charges that I'm showing are January 20, 2025. The amount on that is $154.55 and that's listed as Labcorp.
Speaker1 : Okay.
Speaker2 : And the 2nd one looks like it is February 6, 2025 for $455. And that one just states Gm Canada. It really doesn't give me any much more information than that.
Speaker1 : Oh, okay. It was for. My wife Vacation is uh. What is it? Give me one. Yeah. The metrology She prescribed a sack.
Speaker0 : Uh, okay.
Speaker2 : That makes sense. So typically what we would actually need is one of two different documents. One could come directly from the provider. That would be an itemized statement or a bill. And we normally look for five specific pieces on that type of document. That would be the patient name. The name of the provider or facility that did the treatment. The date of service. The type of service And then the final patient out of pocket responsibility, basically how much you owed after insurance or discounts were applied. And if this was actually something, that bill through insurance and alternative to the itemized statement would be the insurance explanation of benefits. And you can either reach out to your insurance carrier and they can send that to you or send it straight to us.
Speaker1 : Okay.
Speaker3 : Yes.
Speaker1 : Okay.
Speaker0 : And the other one
Speaker1 : I don't know, I have a lot of use from Labcorp. And I don't know, it's, I have my wife, my son and me. But I don't know how to get the information.
Speaker2 : Okay. Well, if that's something that went through insurance. Insurance Should have that. If not, I do show a contact number here for Lab Corps billing department and they might be able to assist you with that.
Speaker1 : Okay. Can you give me the amount is. In the bill so I can, if they ask me, I can provide that.
Speaker2 : Yes, it's $154. And $0.55 So 01:54 .55
Speaker1 : One Five Four
Speaker2 : .55
Speaker1 : Five
Speaker3 : Yes.
Speaker1 : Okay, and now what is the phone number?
Speaker2 : The phone number is one 800. 845. 6167.
Speaker1 : It doesn't say the name from the person. That use the lab or anything else.
Speaker2 : We actually don't have that information. Yeah. It doesn't tell us who it was for, and that's typically why we ask for that documentation. We don't know.
Speaker1 : Yes, I understand. Okay. I want to call them and try to get the view and all the information that you need.
Speaker2 : Did you have any other questions for us?
Speaker1 : Okay, my wife needs another. Authentic injection How I can put in the car. So. It can go through I need to send the information. About the last one.
Speaker2 : Okay, so once you get the documentation for that, either from insurance or from that provider, you can upload it directly to the account online. It would be the same with the lab court bill. Once you have either the explanation of benefits or the itemized statement, it can be uploaded. Ozempic is an eligible expense if it's prescribed by her Dr., so we wouldn't ask for anything unusual other than the itemized receipt for that or the bill.
Speaker1 : Okay.
Speaker3 : Yes.
Speaker1 : So she needs to get there. For the 1st one. right. And then I'll send it to you.
Speaker2 : Correct.

Speaker1 : Thank you. So that phone number would be 374 hundred 406-60-4804.
Speaker2 : Correct.
Speaker1 : Thank you. And how can I assist you for today, Mr.? Pipes?
Speaker3 : Just had some questions so it doesn't look like I've been getting any contributions from my company. I don't know if I didn't sign up for it correctly this year, but.
Speaker2 : Basically was just seeing if there's a way that I could withdraw the funds because I don't really need access to this anymore.
Speaker1 : All right, I understand your concern. And thank you for reaching out. And I'll make sure it addressed accordingly. It shows here that yes, there is no additional contribution. From your employer. So for that one, if you would like to withdraw the available funds on the account, you just need to. Would you like this account to remain? Open or you would like to close the account.
Speaker2 : I'm fine with leaving it open. I just want to withdraw the amount that I have in there right now. I kind of need the money for other uses. I just got through my Va disability stuff, so I'm kind of covered through the Va now, so I don't really need this as much as prior.
Speaker1 : Alright, I understand that. So for you to withdraw the funds. You need to log in to your secure member portal online at www. dot inspire.com. Okay, and as I can see here that you just link your bank account. So it shows here that the bank has not yet validated. So generally it will take up to. Three business days for the link back account to be complete since you were gonna receive a micro deposit for less than a dollar for validation. So I recommend that once the bank account has already validated, then you can request funds. So there is an option on the online. If you would like, we can do share screen and walk you through how you can request funds online.
Speaker2 : Can I go ahead and request that without validating?
Speaker1 : Okay, because It Might be the funds will not be credited to your bank account.
Speaker2 : Okay. Okay.
Speaker1 : Request Yes, for the request funds, it will take also up to five business days for our support specialist to review. And And once you receive the funds. You still need to use that one for medical expenses since the. The Irs will still gonna audit those. Funds or money
Speaker2 : So it has to be used for medical expenses.
Speaker1 : Yes.
Speaker2 : Okay, never mind then. I guess I have no reason to pull it out.
Speaker1 : Alright, so far now have I answered your concern for today?
Speaker2 : Yep, thank you. Have a good day.

Speaker3 : Attention to detail that we appreciate of having the authorization to release personal information on file and for nearly everything we can certainly work with.
Speaker1 : Mr. Hendricks as well. But regarding fraud, we do require The account holder on the line. So thank you so much for staying on the line with us.
Speaker3 : I understand that you have Reviewed your account and recognize there are some Fraudulent transactions from Amazon.
Speaker2 : That's correct.
Speaker1 : All right, so let's walk through if you don't mind. So if I'm going to ask a few questions, if you don't mind, some of them may be a repeat of what the prior representative asked. If I understand correctly from her, you have never used your Hsa debit card for an Amazon purchase. Is that correct?
Speaker2 : That's right. We only use it at the pharmacy. As a matter of fact, I was at the pharmacy on. This past Saturday to pick up some Prescriptions for my son for school and they wouldn't accept my card. And I thought that was weird. That never happened before. And the lady told me I needed to use another card that she said I didn't have enough money in the account. Which I knew wasn't TRUE, but I used another card. I'm assuming maybe someone has already realized that it's fraudulent and. Therefore wouldn't let. That's never happened where I couldn't use my. My Hsa card before. You are exactly correct. So what we did was we identified.
Speaker1 : On July 24 that there were some potentially fraudulent charges on your account. And we put notification to that effect on your. Account And restricted the debit card to where it wouldn't process. So that that didn't go through forward. so let's walk through at this point. Yeah, go ahead.
Speaker2 : There were a series of Amazon charges after the 24th.
Speaker3 : I'm not finding any.
Speaker1 : Oh yeah, there was one July 28. It didn't. it's a. Yes, the one from July 28 did go through.
Speaker2 : Actually there are three, I think.
Speaker3 : All right, give me just a moment. We'll take a look at the account together and we'll walk through the charges. So. The most recent one is the one you just mentioned for July 28 for $15.04.
Speaker1 : The next one I'm looking at was initiated on July 23.
Speaker3 : Finalized on July 28 for $48.10.
Speaker2 : You right? I was looking at the posted date.
Speaker1 : I understand. Give me just a moment. We'll keep working through those.
Speaker3 : The next one I'm showing was initiated on July 23 for $15.04, but it did not go through. The next one was initiated on July 23 for $97.53 and it did process.
Speaker1 : And then the next one was initiated on July 21 for $106.28. And then one on July 19 for Cvs Pharmacy, which I believe you indicated was yours.
Speaker2 : That's ours. All right, let me take a look at a few others. Oh, there's also one from July 12.
Speaker3 : $49.97 Let me look a little farther back just to make sure we're not missing any if you don't mind.
Speaker1 : And then we'll talk about the process going forward. Yeah, I'm not finding any others.
Speaker3 : So what we'll need to do. Is to request A new debit card for you. With a new number, you'll receive that card in ten to 15 business days. And then
Speaker2 : I'm sorry, can we get two cards, one for me and one for my husband?
Speaker3 : Yes. I do show that he already has a card on the account and so both cards will be issued.
Speaker2 : Okay, thank you. You're welcome.
Speaker3 : After I get the card ordered, I'll make a few notes and then what I'll need to do is to get you in contact with Umb Bank. They're the bank that actually issues our debit cards and they'll be able to work with you to get those funds back on your account.
Speaker1 : Okay, thank you. You're welcome.
Speaker3 : Any questions at this point?
Speaker2 : Any questions? No, the car is stopped as of now. Right. I'm going. Yes, it'll.
Speaker3 : Take me about Two or 3 min, but yes.
Speaker1 : That doesn't prevent us from paying bills through the website. Correct. it will not

Speaker2 : Well, I guess I'm calling to find out. A couple of things, but what I'm interested in doing is seeing about what the costs are. To enroll For Cobra benefits for my wife for the month of August and the month of September. And then also what the cost would be for myself and my wife for those same months.
Speaker1 : Okay, yeah, I can definitely look into that for you. And I guess like what the options are, I mean, in terms of.
Speaker2 : Well, The different types of coverages. I guess because I dental, that kind of thing is not necessary but anyway.
Speaker1 : Okay, so. Are you wanting to know the amount? For dental, medical Prescription vision, which Plans
Speaker2 : Yeah, so I guess. My question would be then, what are my options? I mean, to have basically what amounts to minimal coverage through Cobra for my wife for the next two months. That would be, I guess, the easiest way to put it.
Speaker1 : Okay, so. Because I do see that you do have the option for all four of those for dental, medical. Prescription and vision For dental For now. well, what I see 1st, I'll tell you, is for if it's you and your spouse. So for dental it would be 6339. For Medical $1472.92 For prescription, it's no charge and vision is $13.46. That's for the both of you.
Speaker2 : Okay.
Speaker1 : Let me see. And give me just a moment while I get the amounts for if it's just you.
Speaker2 : Well, I can enroll just her, correct?
Speaker1 : Yeah, that's what I mean.
Speaker2 : Yeah, I have the form that was sent. I mean, so I'm looking at the alternate coverage available. I'm assuming it's, you know. I don't know if it's member only is the same price as what my wife would be, but. I didn't mean to interrupt you, but I guess once that's determined, then I guess the other question is, are there options to change the actual plan? To a less costly plan As opposed to what I had previously, I guess is the question. It looks like I med Hp, right? Medical plan, whatever that was. And I understand that. yeah, 14 7292 was the cost for both my wife and I. Each month moving forward. And then below it, it has alternate coverage available, the same plan, the Marit 3500 Cd Hp medical member only. And basically it's, you know, half of that 600 7388 roughly. So is that the cost that my wife would pay or that I would pay for my wife? I should say for medical only.
Speaker1 : Yes. If it was just for one person, it would be that amount.
Speaker2 : Okay, and then is there an option to change the specific type of plan? In other words, instead of the Hurricane 3500, I know there were other types of plans that were available. I don't know what they are now, quite frankly, but. Is that an option as well?
Speaker1 : Okay, give me just a moment. I am going to double check into that. I'll be right back with you. Okay, okay. Thank you. Thank you so much for holding for me. So the only options through Cobra are what is the plan that is listed? I mean, you can always look through like. The marketplace. Sometimes maybe there may be other options, but as far as like through Cobra, the plans that are listed are the only options you would have.
Speaker2 : Okay. And then I noticed on the form that was sent that. If I chose to enroll. My spouse only That I cannot do it online. That I need to either Mail in the information or can I do that over the phone?
Speaker1 : No, so you would need to complete that. Form that was sent and mail it in.
Speaker2 : Gotcha. Okay. Okay, well that answers that question, so I appreciate your help. Thank you.

With that, they told me they'd be in touch in five days and I haven't heard back anything yet, so I'm just trying to stay on top of it and find out if there's been any progress.
Speaker2 : All right, let me put you on hold. Let me look at the notes and see if there's any notes with an update on it. Give me about 2 min. Okay, sure. Thanks. All right, Miss Miller. So the last thing I see on the notes was dated 07:24 stating that. They were going back and forth with you on needing the check number and the amount. And from that moment on, I don't see anything else.
Speaker1 : But it's an active investigation. They sent it for investigation, right? Yeah, it is still being investigated. They're still looking for the check. Okay, I mean they told me it could take up to five days and that was what date?
Speaker2 : That was, well, the last note I seen was 07:24.
Speaker1 : Okay. So that's five days. Can we escalate this to a supervisor or something?
Speaker2 : Today's the 4th day because we don't count Saturday and Sunday.
Speaker1 : Okay. Well, you count the 2425, 2829. Today's the 5th day. No.
Speaker2 : Well, the 24th is the last note that I've seen, so. I don't ever count that day. I always count the next business day. So that's 25th, 28th, 29th, and 30th.
Speaker1 : Right, but I initially started this investigation, I think several days before that even. And then she called back because she was like, oh, well, what is the check number? And I said, I just, I already told somebody the check number the other day. The 1st woman I talked to, she started the investigation several days before that. And then they were like, oh, we need the check number. And I was like, I already gave it to you. And they're like, oh, we thought that was the amount. I'm like, no, that's the actual check number. So, you know, the investigation was already initiated several days before. I mean, I can get you a supervisor if you want one. Yeah, I mean, I just, you know. I'm leaving, I'm going to be out of, I'm going to Europe on the 5th. So I really would like to have this straightened out before then somehow.
Speaker2 : Well, let me place you on hold and I'll see what I can do to get you a supervisor. Okay, all right, I would appreciate it. Thank you so much. No problem. Hey, Miss Miller. Yes. I've got a supervisor looking at the account right now and she's going to get right back with me. So I'm going to place you back on hold. I just didn't want you to think I forgot about you. I appreciate that. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Thanks. Miss Miller. Yes. So she asked me if I could get a callback number for you, which is, I'm guessing it is a 610. 6130138. She says she's going to research that and see what she can find out.
Speaker1 : That would be great. Yeah, that's my phone number.
Speaker2 : Okay, so let me send that off to her real quick while I got you on the line. And she will call you as soon as she finds out something. Okay, all right. And what is her name?

Speaker2 : You're saying that anytime I make an Amazon purchase, that'll probably happen.
Speaker1 : In the future. You probably shouldn't make it with the card. If you want to get something off Amazon that's Fsa eligible, I'd recommend out of pocketing it and then just filing for reimbursement because. The thing about Amazon is. They don't require Positive identification so they don't have to verify your identity. And they also don't require a security code for charging cards. All they require is a name. You can make up a name and. A card number and they'll charge the card. So that makes it really, really easy for people to commit fraud. So if you do use it on Amazon, it's going to get flagged pretty much every time. So we recommend that for now. You just refrain from using the card on the pay flex card on Amazon. So give me 1 s here. Non fraudulent Debit card transaction

I think it was at the end of 2020. What's the 2023? Okay, because I retired in 2024. And so I went into the drugstore today. To use it for the 1st time since I retired and And since you sent me the new cards, because the old card had expired and it didn't work, you know, the drug store said, oh, it's not going through. So I don't know if it's active or I have to do something to activate it. My other card worked, you know, before I. Before you sent me this card. So that's my dilemma. Are you there?

Speaker1 : Okay, I do apologize about that hole. Mr. Conley, are you still there? I am. Okay, the reason the card is not working is because you're no longer with Inspire Financial anymore. You have to call the health equity number, which I have the one 800 number. They will let you know about the status of your balances and what you can do with those funds. Would you like that?
Speaker2 : Can you just go back up? In the beginning you said it's not working because why?
Speaker1 : You're not inspire with Inspire Financial anymore.
Speaker2 : Oh. Is that TRUE with any New York life people?
Speaker1 : Yeah, they were sent to a new vendor in 2024. so it's health equity now. So you have to contact them about your funds and things. Now we don't have the. Balances or your information anymore. Oh well, that's interesting. Yes, sir. Would you like the one 800 number?

Speaker3 : I am not familiar with their plan, but I'm looking at it says if you meet all conditions listed above, you may apply at. That web address there It looks like it's a Hipaa address. Health insurance premium payment program. So yeah, I don't know what the eligibility requirements are, but it sounds like, you know, you don't meet them.
Speaker1 : No. I don't
Speaker2 : Okay, yeah, apart from that, that's the only extension option I'd be aware of. From there, I would just refer you to the healthcare Dot Gov to explore options. Get a quote there for comparable plans.

Speaker2 : Okay, thank you. And as my final question for SE. Account. Can you also confirm the last four digits of your Inspiron or Pay Flex debit card number?
Speaker1 : I don't have my card. My wife has my card, so I don't have that.
Speaker4 : Ok, we do have a couple of alternatives. So one of the alternatives is to provide one of the last three payroll deductions that were taken out of the account or out of your paycheck, I'm sorry, and applied to the account with the dollar amount in the date of that contribution.
Speaker2 : The 2nd alternative that we have is to provide one of the last three payments out of the account with the dollar amount in the date of that transaction.
Speaker1 : I don't think I contribute on a paycheck by paycheck basis anymore. I used to, so I don't think there's going to be a transaction history for that. As far as an outgoing, my wife uses it the most. Mostly, I think she uses it for. Some of her therapy stuff. I think the last Charge is probably Linda, maybe Linda six. I don't know if that's her last name or not. I can't remember. It's usually like 20 bucks or 30 bucks or something like that. And I don't know the date. I asked my wife to send me a photo of the card. I'm just waiting to see because she's at work so I don't know if she's going to be able to send it to me right away, but. Yeah, so the reason I'm calling. Is every year We Go and do like the screening stuff like they go and they draw the blood and we go and do the, you know, whatever they do the tests and stuff like that. And Chase usually deposits cash into that account every year and I think it's 500 bucks a piece. Last year or two years ago. My wife forgot to do like some online assessment or something in time. so we only got 500. but this year I made sure that it was done. But I don't see, and we just haven't used it. I don't think that much unless she has and I just don't. I just don't know, we spent it already. But I didn't really see a lot of transactions when I was online before I left for lunch. And because I was online looking at it and I just don't feel like. The funds were ever deposited
Speaker4 : Right, right. Okay, okay. So. Now I can Because this is considered more general information. I would be able to assist with this by saying that.
Speaker2 : When it comes to those incentive services that you can receive in exchange for funds being placed into the accounts. Unfortunately, we are. We're limited to what we receive from the insurance company.
Speaker4 : So if you feel like they have not deposited anything, like if you, if you feel like you have not gotten the deposits that you should have gotten, I would definitely recommend calling out to your insurance company.
Speaker2 : To ask about those wellness incentives. And find out because sometimes things do get stuck in the system, you know.
Speaker1 : Okay, so you suggest calling Aetna directly?
Speaker4 : Right, yes sir. And I would have them go over like the wellness incentives that you have completed and like when they were done and.
Speaker2 : When they were sent over. Just so that way you can compare them with your records. I have my edna card, so.
Speaker3 : I really don't know. I guess I'll just call the main line.
Speaker4 : Yes, the customer service number. The customer service number on the back should take you to your dedicated department with that.
Speaker3 : Okay, I'll call them because. I didn't see it online. I was just on there and I just left for lunch and I should have called while I was still sitting at my desk, but I wouldn't be able to give you all this. But I just didn't see one of those. I didn't see anything deposit and I don't think my wife spent basically 1000 bucks. I see there's only 13 bucks in there. I don't think we've spent a thousand dollars this year. So it's like, I just don't think it was deposited. Okay, I'll call them and see if they can help me. Okay.
Speaker4 : Okay, all right. And was there anything else that I could do to assist you today while I had you here on the phone with me or any other questions that you might have?
Speaker3 : No, that'll be it. Thank you.

I'm so sorry about that.
Speaker2 : So you can give me everything but the 1st four and then the app will give me the last four.

Speaker2 : Okay.
Speaker1 : Okay, I'm going to patch you in. He says he can do it real quick, so. Okay, so let me just do this. Okay. Jake Jake Kristen.

Yep, it's going to be John Daniels, 112 Quail Run, Glastonbury, Connecticut, 06033. Perfect. And then what are the last four of the social just to fully secure it is 9970. Okay, thank you so much. I can I'll go ahead and and speak to her
Speaker1 : All right, thank you.
Speaker2 : You're welcome. All right. So Thank you. I did get a response back from the account manager because this account and he's no longer with the company. We no longer have the funds. So this is just. We have the funds, the employer always has the funds. And then when you file a claim, we reach out and they fund it to reimburse anyone. But do have a contact number so you'd have to work directly with the employer. So it's not an Inspire issue. So I have their contact information that you would contact. To them directly
Speaker1 : Okay, so when. An employee leaves, you distribute the funds back to the employer.
Speaker2 : Right. It's always They're always the, we're just like the middleman, so they always have the funds.
Speaker1 : Okay.
Speaker2 : So we, like, they always have the funds. they fund us. So when you file a claim. We send the claim over to, we send the amount that we need to pay out the. Whoever is sending that claim, that employer or employee who's ever filing that claim, and then that's how they get reimbursed. So we don't actually have like a specific account for them. so we send file. So that's how the funding works. So because this was in 2024. No longer This is all up to the employer, so we don't deal with this at all. So this wouldn't be an Inspire issue, but I do have their contact number.
Speaker1 : Okay, and shouldn't they have sent an email or informed the employee that they have these funds?
Speaker2 : Well, so because it's a dependent care account and it's considered a use it or lose it account, I mean, you have a run out period. So that would be something that, you know, when you're signing up for the program, you kind of sign, you have until this date to file the claim and this day to claim for the funds.
Speaker1 : So, and I won't hold you to this. I'm just trying to learn. But so, because he doesn't have dependents. And it was supposed to be an Hsa and he said he changed it over online. I mean, shouldn't the employer have. Yeah, isn't there some information that should have been conveyed to the. Well, again, he thought it was an Hsa account, so. Okay, do you have any idea?
Speaker2 : That's actually kind of what the dependent, I mean the the human resources department because Yeah, I mean they don't typically say, oh, because I'm sure they don't know he's just signing it up for dependent care. That's the file feed we got. So that's the account that was open. So I don't know if they knew that he didn't have any dependent or that was just what was selected. So I'm not sure if they would reach out and say, oh, hang on, there's a, depending on your account. Let's switch it over.
Speaker1 : Okay, so do you have, and I won't hold you to this. Do you have any idea? What is likely to happen in this situation?
Speaker2 : I'm not, it's through the employer of what they want to do. So I really, I'm not sure of what, how they would want to proceed, but. They just said that it's no longer and it's not an Inspire issue because we don't have those funds. But then she did provide. A contact number. It's Jennifer Ballantine that you can connect with directly and so you can work with her. On what can be done about the account opened an error.
Speaker1 : Okay, and that's Jennifer Ballantine. Okay, and Is there a number
Speaker2 : Yes, it's 215.
Speaker1 : Okay.
Speaker2 : Four Three zero
Speaker1 : Yep.
Speaker2 : 9080.
Speaker1 : Okay, and Any reason that Why it would have taken You know, me, you know, seven phone calls and you getting involved to get this information.
Speaker2 : She did notate the account. I think it just can depend on because. The account manager works as like the Liaison between us and the employer. So it could have been the employer was just researching it or she was just waiting on them to get back to her. I'm not sure. I don't know why it did take such a long time. I'm sorry about that.
Speaker1 : Okay, and do you know, has Jennifer been in touch with Hr so they know that this is, you know, that this is what we're looking for.
Speaker2 : Yes, so they've been, the case was sent over to them and they do know the background of it.
Speaker1 : Okay, and was it sent over back in June or just recently?
Speaker2 : I'm not sure about that.
Speaker1 : Okay. Okay, okay. Well, thank you, Kristen for calling back.
Speaker2 : You're welcome. Is there anything else I can assist you with while I have you on the line?
Speaker1 : No. That's it. Unless there's anything that you think would be helpful in trying to get this resolved. With the Hr department over there.

Speaker1 : Got it. How can I hope
Speaker2 : I received some paperwork that you all needed more information about some purchases I had made and I fax that in. On 07:21 So I just need to make sure my accounts cleared up so y'all got it and processed it and the app can't get my password to work on the app, so I'm having to call you.
Speaker1 : Okay. So you submitted it for an overpayment, correct?
Speaker2 : No, I bought some glasses and then I went to the Dr., and it should have been covered using my card and it says that they need more information about my purchases. So I faxed the Ebs in you. Showing where I bought my eyeglasses and went to the Dr., Because I don't want you to see one of those tax forms in the mail like, you know, like you did the last time this happened. So.
Speaker1 : Okay, he said it's for the eye. Dr., what was the amount?
Speaker2 : Looks like seven 9320. I'm not sure that's what I paid when I was there. I don't know. Did you get the pay? Do you show that somebody's gotten the paperwork and cleared it up on my account?
Speaker1 : Okay, let me see what the most recent document is that we sent to you so I can try to reference and find the correct one. So It looks like we sent you a documentation asking for three purchases in total. One was for $339.21, another one was for $25, and the 3rd one was for $401.48. Are you saying you sent something for all of these? All three of these?
Speaker2 : Actually, you know what, I don't think I sent one for the Eye I Center of Oak Ridge, now that I'm looking at this. So you should have two of the three.
Speaker1 : Okay, so let me go check the other ones for you.
Speaker2 : Okay, so that's simply like a copy for the eye. Dr., I mean, do you know, do I have to fax this in every time on this when I go to the Dr.? This is kind of ridiculous.
Speaker1 : So what happens, why it even acts that in the 1st place is that you'll go somewhere and you'll use the debit card and then it's the debit card reader that you're swiping it through. It's supposed to send us back the information of the purchase so we know what it was that you got done. But for some reason, some debit card readers at these places don't do that and it triggers an automated response in the system. Hey, can you, can you submit this over to us? Now I do see here for the three transactions I just listed, all of them say complete on my side. So you are. Nothing else is needed.
Speaker2 : Okay, perfect. Okay, that's what I needed to know. Okay, sorry, I'm just like frustrated.
Speaker1 : Yeah, you're all okay.
Speaker2 : Okay, that's what I needed. All right, thank you. Have a good

Speaker2 : Okay, that's easy enough to help you with. Are you logged in right now? You said you inspire financial. Okay, we do have a share. My screen option. If you look at the bottom of the page, I'm logging in there right now myself. That's usually the best way to guide you through the website.

Speaker1 : It's 9499.
Speaker0 : Nine

All right, now I can get in there and join you. All right, so here I am. I can move my mouse around, scroll and point, but not click on anything. But yeah, you're referring to this urgent action here. So basically this is your balance remaining that you have to use up until August 31. You have until December 31 of 2025 to file any claims. The place to go 1st is the view account details. It's not real clear, but that's where you go here to take you to a new screen. I can only point, go ahead and click on that. Oh, and your employer does allow you to carry over up to $640 I saw there on that previous screen. So if you. All that you can. Yeah, on that screen. You're allowed to have $640 of carryover. So the way you want to go to verify this is this one here, the verify card purchases. Otherwise you're going to need to pay that amount back. That's showing. Wait for that to come up. Okay, so these two transactions need to be verified by you. Let me open up something on my end here before I get too far ahead of the game because your card is temporarily inactive.

Speaker0 : Oh.
Speaker1 : Okay. Okay. And so then to get back.
Speaker2 : There is a, let me get on your screen again, there's a back button right here and then you should be able to go back into the other. Through verify card purchases again. I think it'll take you back that far. Yep, there you go.
Speaker1 : Okay. Card purchases claims verify card purchases.
Speaker2 : Yes, ma'am. And then there's the other one.

Speaker2 : That's not the one holding up your card. So you can get that when you need it, when you get it and upload it here. But that's proactive. We most likely won't be able to, that's a dentist, so we won't probably be able to verify that. Sometimes your medical ones look like they get verified, but the dental did not. So you got one of them uploaded three to five business days to process the one that you submitted and that should get your card reactivated. Meantime, if you have anything that you paid out of pocket, you can submit for it. And yeah, that's where you needed to go. Sorry about it being confusing, but you can cancel that since you don't have the documents for this one. Okay, okay.
Speaker1 : All righty. Okay, all right, thank you.
Speaker2 : That was all for you today.

Speaker2 : Is a service date of May 7 where there is a charge for 2050 that we put on this Fsa card and I have been calling about this for a number of times, but I still keep getting these notices. I uploaded document a few times already on your website. I still keep getting the submit. Some eligible stuff or pay back this amount.

Speaker1 : I am still looking into this. I do apologize for the whole. Thank you for your patience. If you would allow me a few more moments. Yeah, yeah, no problem. Thanks. I do apologize for the hold and I thank you very much for your patience. So I was looking within the account as far as that amount is concerned for the 2050. The documentation that you had submitted is an itemized statement that has information stating that estimated insurance was involved. So anytime that they see estimated insurance on the. Receipt, they automatically ask for the Eob, which is generated by the dental insurance provider. It has all five pieces of information within there, but most importantly, what it contains is what you as the member was financially responsible for and what insurance was financially responsible for. You would be able to still upload that information. Directly to the account via the website. And allow five days for it to be processed and then from there for those funds to be released. I'm sorry for those funds to be that were used to be used. yeah, stay used.
Speaker2 : Okay, so you you want the Eob so I need to go to the insurance. Which in that case was, I think. Was that it now? I think it was eight now at that point in time. Okay, so I need to see, go on their website. Hopefully I still have access because I left the company Cvs Health in the end of June. Okay, okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker1 : I was going to say I don't have access to like Ebs on this end. Oh, you don't have? Okay, Okay, so I'll go download it from the insurance website and then upload it to your site.
Speaker2 : Right, right. Is that that's the next step? Okay, okay. All right, thank you very much.
Speaker1 : Most welcome. Did you have any additional questions?
Speaker2 : No, not right now. I think if we can get this resolved, I'm glad you looked into it because last couple of times I called, I didn't get the clear direction here, so.
Speaker1 : Thank you for that. Most welcome if you don't have any additional questions. You have a great day and thank you for calling. Inspired. Yeah, you too. Bye now.

Speaker0 : Thank you and James.
Speaker1 : Calling because I received the Requirement for the documents which I uploaded them in the app. And I recently got a letter saying that the car has been suspended because of the transition that I mentioned, the one on 03:19. 2025 for 02:40 01:20 I have loaded the documents they provided to me, so I don't know what else I need to do.
Speaker4 : So kindly, I can definitely look into your account to see what has taken place. If you don't mind, I do want to place you on a brief for about two to 3 min so I can go ahead and review your documents and also see if there was a decision.
Speaker2 : On that documentation prior to us sending out the deactivation. Okay, okay, so I do see there was, it looks like we did send out. An Eop report explanation of payments on June 12. And it looks like it stated that this expense is not eligible for reimbursement and has been denied. It looks like that expense must have occurred during your period coverage. Oh, I'm sorry. It says it must be in cured during your Paris coverage. It looks like It is going to be based off of the service date. So I'm assuming that this service was before your plan year. Started. So let me just double check some things with your account. One moment.
Speaker0 : Okay.
Speaker2 : I see your Fsa started.
Speaker4 : January of 2025 and ends December of 2025. All right, so Mrs. Golly, I'm just going to place you on a brief for about 2 min. I'm going to review that document and then. Based off of that date, I'm going to see if we need to just resubmit it back to the claims department. If not, then it looks like that it is stating that it was occurred outside of your plan year. But I do want to double check for you. So just bear with me. I'll be back with you shortly.
Speaker1 : Okay, thank you. You're welcome.
Speaker4 : All right, thank you so much, Mrs., Conley for patiently waiting. So I did double check. It looks like your plan year was Act.
Speaker1 : Hello.
Speaker4 : I do Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. Yes, so I stated that I did go ahead and review your documentation. I do see that your plan year was active during the time of this purchase or service.
Speaker3 : As it did start January of 2025 and this was dated for March 17. so it was within your plan year. So what I did was go ahead and get this resubmitted over to the claims department to review it. Please advise it does take about five business days to fully process that once they do receive it.
Speaker1 : Okay, so then. I will receive something in the mail or.
Speaker4 : Yes, so it does take about three to five business days. so I will give it just allow the four or five business days. So I would say this time next week you should have a status on it. You can also check your online account, but you will be notified by mail, I'm sorry, via email and on your online account.
Speaker1 : Okay. Thank you so much. I appreciate your help. Oh no, you're more than welcome. But outside of that, Mrs., Conley, was there any more questions that I may be able to assist you with? No, that was it. Thank you. I appreciate it.

The customer service line that would be 800-473-9595. What? You will be doing is choosing the option number three so you can could be redirected to the Cobra department.
Speaker1 : You know. I'm not on Cobra. And the number that I got to call was. Let's see. I think it's the 866-996-5200.
Speaker2 : Okay, give me one moment so I could try to pull up your account here by any chance since you mentioned that. We don't have Account But in terms of your account here with benefit free sports, what type of account are you currently enrolled in?
Speaker1 : Well, it's a premium payment notice, so. What happened is my human resources department forwarded all my mail when I notified them of my retirement. So I am just getting everything today because I didn't relocate until today. So when I called this morning to set up a payment, the person I spoke with said to. Go to page eight of the letter I have and set up an account and I could do that. I did. Unfortunately, that's for Cobra coverage. So when I called back. I scheduled I'm sorry, I'm getting a bad echo. I can't even hear myself.
Speaker2 : I'm very sorry about that. It seems that yes, I'm still here.
Speaker1 : So then I spoke with a woman and she said, no, it' it's a different letter, it's a different registration code. So I took care of that and I actually made the payment. But I'm worried that I've also elected Cobra because of being directed to the other. Other What do you call it? Registration code by the person I 1st spoke with. So I'm worried that I've got two types of coverage going at the same time. At the same time,
Speaker2 : I understand. I'm very sorry about that, but in terms of your concern here, since you mentioned that you were able to opt or essentially enroll into a covert coverage, would that be your main concern for this call?
Speaker1 : My main concern is that I don't want to have opted or elected for Cobra coverage and I've already paid. For the appropriate Premium with the city health plan.
Speaker2 : Okay, I understand. So. Your monthly premiums are not through Bri. With another Administrator, is that correct?
Speaker1 : I don't know how it works, but I just paid 07:50 09:38. And the Cobra plan is I'm just concerned because when I was directed to that. Code I had to select Election options and I'm afraid that I've opted into Cobra as well.

Speaker2 : Hi. I need to see how many payments did I just recently. Make on this account. Because I feel like I just made a. Payment And then I just made another one. Are you able to check that?
Speaker1 : I am, let me look here. So you do not have another payment due until September. So September, the 1st premium payments are due on the 1st. You just made one. Yes, on today's date. So that would be, that's going to go towards your August bill. You made one July 28. And Those are the only two in the same month. Everything else was monthly. June May. April, March, February.
Speaker2 : So July 28. I just made a payment.
Speaker1 : You made a payment on July the 28th. And then you made one that looks like today.
Speaker2 : Yeah. So that July 28 should have covered what? August, right
Speaker1 : Yes, so the one you made today is going to cover your August. Premium
Speaker2 : The July 28, which is two days ago. Right.
Speaker1 : July 28 was two days ago. Let me take a look at all of your payments here. So you started in October.
Speaker2 : That should have I feel like I just made a, okay, so in October.
Speaker1 : You made a payment that was for your November. The October payment was for November. When you enrolled, the November payment was for December. The December payment was for January. You didn't make a payment in January. You made a payment in February. And then March, April, May. June 26, July 28, and July 30.
Speaker2 : So that's what I'm saying. So this July 28.
Speaker1 : Yeah, so you're not going to, you're not going to need to make a payment as of right now. the system says September the 1st. And it shows your last payment, which was today's date already. So you're paid through August 31.
Speaker2 : Right. That payment from the 28 What was that to cover?
Speaker1 : That was to cover your July. Benefits July 28 covered July. You hadn't made your July payment yet. So payments are due on the 1st and you do have a 30 day grace period. Now you can set up recurring payments if you want to set up recurring so that you don't have to worry about going in there and making them. We do those on the 8th of each month. They pull the payment for that month on the 8th of each month. And then the 8th is a weekend or holiday. We pull it the following business day.
Speaker2 : Okay. So that That payment for the 28th went through already.
Speaker1 : Yes, sir. So you're paid up until September the 1st.
Speaker2 : And then this payment that I just made.
Speaker1 : Is going towards August. Your August premium.
Speaker2 : Okay. So why don't it? Okay. Guess I'm a little, a little confused because I know I have made that payment. On the 28th
Speaker1 : And you did, and that was for your July. But when you went in there to make a payment today, that was already for the next month. That was for August, which starts in two days on Friday. So you're, you've already paid your August payment. You won't have to go in there and make a payment in August.
Speaker2 : All right.
Speaker1 : You know, if you You know, if it looks like you're going in there and making your payments monthly, if you don't want to do that, you can set up the automatic. And that's just an option online. When you're in your online account where you go to select make a payment, it says, would you like to enroll in automatic payments? And you just click on that option.
Speaker2 : Yeah, I'm just. I guess I'm just confused why. I had Because I made this, I know I had made this payment for the 28. But I didn't realize it was because I was. Like behind it.
Speaker1 : So looking at Your list of payments, well, like I said, there is a 30 day grace period, so you can still go in there and make your payments. Looking at your list, when you started your Cobra in October, October 29, your 1st payment, that was for November. Because you were paying for November because your benefit started November the 1st. Then when you made your payment November 17, that was for December. When you made your December payment on December 7, that was actually for January. February the 6th, you made a payment and that was for February. March 6 for March. April 23 was your April premium. May 24 was your May premium. June 26 was your June premium. July 28 two days ago was your July premium. And then this today's payment is your August premium.
Speaker2 : Okay. So Can that be canceled or no?
Speaker1 : I don't believe so. Let me only if the benefits are canceled, bear with me one moment.
Speaker2 : Because if I I should still have it. How is the pay? This premium, right?
Speaker1 : Yeah, but now refunds for Cobra premiums, refunds for premiums can take up to 30 days. To have that refunded.
Speaker2 : Okay.
Speaker1 : But I'm finding out. Bear with me. Is it okay if I put you on a brief hold for about 3 min?
Speaker2 : Yeah. And Don't cancel it.
Speaker1 : We're not. I'm not. I can't cancel it at all. I can't cancel it, but I am checking to see about that. If they can refund it, bear with me. I'll be right back with you. Mr. Smith, thank you for holding. So yes, we can put a request in to refund it, but it would take up to 30 days for you to get a refund and then you're going to have your August payment due again.
Speaker2 : No. Okay.
Speaker1 : All right, is there any other questions or anything else I can help you with?

Speaker3 : Are calling about her Fsa as well as her limited purpose Fsa. She has an active Fsa with us. However, she did have a, there was a limited purpose Fsa. And it was only for like one day and that was June 1 to June 1 of 2025. She swiped her card and the funds pulled from the limited purpose Fsa even though there were no, there was no balance. So she thought that she's always had a limited purpose Fsa, but it looks like that she had one and then the other. So we're just trying to get you to shed some light on this, on how this happened. And then I'll. See what I would be able to do to move forward with her from there.
Speaker1 : Gotcha. Let's see what we got. Let me just take a look real quick at the account. Have the hybrid gold plan. So with that being said, you can't have a limited purpose with that one because the only time you get limited purpose is if you have an account. That has an Hsa So they're enrolled in the normal flexible spending account, which makes sense. Let me see if there was any kind of. Change made. Maybe she requested it to be changed like the plan. Aware that they had Okay, that's not sent in. I'm just saying if maybe she put in any cases about it.
Speaker3 : May I place you on a very brief hold? I do need to check. Yeah, sure. Thank you. Okay, chastity. Thank you so much for holding.
Speaker1 : You're welcome. Some spinning Let's see. What this one says. Yeah, it looks like they may have. Been enrolled in Some sort of plan because I can see where we. It looks like we put in money to an Hsa, so I'm thinking it's because they had a different plan and then made changes to it right after.
Speaker3 : I don't see her having an active Hsa. As a matter of fact, her account is in retail status as of right now, and it's a negative $5. There were no contributions that went into the Hsa.
Speaker1 : Yeah, it says on 05:16 and 25, I don't know if maybe that was, it says health savings account Er, which is the employer contributions, not the employee, because it would be Ee. But that's the only other one other than the regular flexible spending account that I can see on my end, which started on ST one.
Speaker3 : Okay.
Speaker1 : I don't see anything else, but I think that it has to do with maybe they did possibly pick the wrong plan and then change their mind.
Speaker3 : I am unsure Am I able to bring her onto the line? Oh yeah, yeah, I'm sorry. I was just kind of trying to check it out and see if I could find anything 1st.

Speaker2 : Zip code is 15681.
Speaker1 : Okay. Come on, computer.
Speaker2 : You can do nothing. And then what are we doing for this member today? Okay, so this is kind of a weird thing. Actually she had called. Back on the 16th or 17th because they had noticed a fraudulent charge of $41.76 on the card. So it looked like they had. Of course canceled the card and sent her out a new one. got shipped on the 23rd and she's just got it today. But they noticed on the transactions that there's another charge on the 21st. For the same amount For the same vendor that's not theirs. It's an Amazon charge. So now I'm sitting here wondering. Has the new card been compromised or was that just one? Because I'm not seeing that authorization on the new card.
Speaker1 : Yeah. It might be on the old cards. Sometimes it takes some time to process through. So that's what I think could be the case. Let's take a look though. See what we can find And you said that the last one was 21 July, that Amazon for the 4176.
Speaker2 : Right, The one previous to that, but that originally got them calling was on 16 July, but it looks like they've canceled that one.
Speaker1 : Yeah, and it's like it just popped right back on the 21st. I don't know.
Speaker2 : I know somebody in your department told me that they were getting the cards really quick now, so I thought, well, that's really quick. They haven't hardly even got it printed out yet.
Speaker1 : Yeah. Some of these cards are really, really moving. Right, let's see what we have here. For 81 76. Okay, so I did find that transaction. It looks like it is listed on the old card that was reported as stolen initially the. 69. So most likely this was a charge that was pending on the prior card and then I just processed later. so the current card should be good. If they see anything, you know, going forward, then Yeah, but yeah, that should. Did they include it with the fraud report?
Speaker2 : Not for the 21st. The only one they did the fraud report on was the 17th or when they called the 17th on the 16th that was canceled, which I thought was weird that it was the same. Exact same amount 4176 Like a week later.
Speaker1 : Yeah. Yeah. Definitely strange, but yeah, it should have just processed through later.
Speaker2 : Okay, so are they going to take the 4176 from the 21st back off again? Because That's not a legitimate charge. I mean, I don't understand why it.
Speaker1 : It would probably have Yeah, yeah, definitely for the 4176 for 21 July, we'll probably have to get the account holder over to, um, to report that one if they haven't already reported it. they already took care of the card. so the cards. fine. I do want to ask to specify if I heard you correctly earlier. You said the spouse. I'm talking to the spouse. Yeah. So I didn't give her a lot of information, but I wasn't sure as far as. We do have to have the account holder on the line, um, won't speak with anyone else. The Rpt mean anything to them so okay, that makes sense. Okay. yeah, I can definitely.
Speaker2 : Let her know to either have him call or verify because he wasn't available.
Speaker1 : Do you want to place me on hold and check with her to see if he. Oh, you said he's not available.
Speaker2 : Let me double check again just to make sure. Hold on just a moment. I'll be right back. Yeah, if you don't mind. Oh yeah, you're fine. Hey Josh.
Speaker1 : Yes, hello. Yeah, he was there. She went and got him. So he's on the phone now. His name is Steven.

Speaker1 : Let me please explain. I work for Allied, a security company. And I'm on medical leave from seven one until October 1. I'm having surgery for my left knee on August 20. and to the surgical coordinator I sent an email to her today. And she sent back to me that I needed to pay $25 to her medical assistant to complete this form. And what popped on my screen was your company and the Inspire card. So I don't know if you deal with Florida medical leave of absence, if I pay you, or I don't know exactly how it works.
Speaker2 : All righty, Mr., Demas, what is your employee Id number?
Speaker1 : It is 976. 976. 1646i believe
Speaker2 : All right, bear with me one moment.
Speaker1 : I should be
Speaker2 : So I'm not pulling up an account for you.
Speaker1 : Let me try again and try this please. 761640. That should be it.
Speaker3 : Okay.
Speaker1 : If not, I can check with my company or the medical surgeon and call back tomorrow.
Speaker2 : Okay, yeah. By name. I'm not even pulling up an account for you. I'm only pulling up, I believe it's an Hsa or an Fsa account that you had with us.
Speaker1 : Excuse me, ma'am, I've never had an account with you. Let me try to explain better before I get off the phone. So I'm in Florida. I work for Allied. Hold it Allied United
Speaker2 : Universal
Speaker1 : Universal And on 07:10, because my left knee is bad, I'm on medical leave, which has been approved to a point until October 1. On August 20, I have the surgery with me in Florida. so I contacted the medical coordinator with the Dr., Abraham, the surgeon, and she came back and said, I need to spend $25 and have a medical assistant help me. Now maybe tomorrow the best thing to do is to call her and pay $25 to her over the phone because I know you deal with retirement, many different accounts. So it's probably better if I thank you for your efforts and call her tomorrow and you'd like to pay her 25 as the surgical coordinator. Because Does that make sense what I just said?
Speaker2 : Yes and no. No, I'm only saying that because. Is your name Don or Donald Demas? D O N. It's just, it's not Donald, it's just Don. Okay.
Speaker1 : I'm not there. I haven't opened an account yet. I understand your financial company, you deal with many different things, but probably what I'll do is call back to the medical surgical coordinator tomorrow, pay her $25, and I'm still going to say thank you for trying to help me because I haven't signed up with your company as yet. No. So the way it works is you wouldn't sign up for us. Your employer would forward us your information.
Speaker2 : So like if your benefits aren't being deducted from your paycheck anymore and you're out on a leave of absence, then you would have to pay us for your benefits. But if you stop working on Seven One, then you should have had an account with us. Are you
Speaker1 : Let me explain one step better. 74 and I never needed my company's benefits, so I'm outside of that realm. So what I'll do is call the surgical coordinator for Sandra tomorrow and try to pay her $25 because I never took the benefits. I'm 74, I have my own benefits. I'm kind of outside of your realm. Does that make sense?
Speaker2 : Correct. So you probably would not have an account with us. I mean, you probably will need to work with the surgical coordinator.
Speaker1 : Correct. And what was your name please? My name is. Well, thank you for your help. And you know, I've made about a hundred thousand phone calls and it's nice to talk to another professional person on the phone. Because you know what I discovered in my 74 years, not everyone is. A professional on the phone, let me say it that way, some people on the phone that should be washing cars or should be. Painting houses or should be volunteering at churches or should be painting pictures to sell or Not everyone, not everyone grows up with etiquette on the phone. Not everyone grows up with education. not everyone grows up with consideration. So you are one of those people. You, are you a trainer? You could be a trainer too.
Speaker2 : No, I am not. I honestly, I never looked into that.
Speaker1 : Well, that's fine because I did it for years and years. I'm a security guard, so I find that more interesting now than the phone. The phone's good, but you know, when you hang it up there, it's a hundred thousand times it's nice to do something different, you know.
Speaker2 : Yeah, I have an aunt. She works for Allied here in Florida as well. Oh really? Okay. We're in Broward County. We have a big operation.
Speaker1 : Okay, well anyway, if I don't see you again, which I probably won't, thank you for your help.
Speaker2 : You're welcome. You're welcome. and good luck on your surgery. Okay, thank you. Bye bye. Alright, you're welcome.

And then they said that they were going to fax you guys like whatever additional information you needed on the form is asking you for the account number. So there I can put my social.
Speaker1 : Exactly, just the last four of your socials to locate your account. And that is correct. You fill out the fidelity transfer form and once you completed that form. You should send or the Fidelity will send that to us here as we will be the one to initiate the transfer to your new administrator. So it says full account number. Should I put the full social? Yes, you can. Okay. Please be advised there will be a $25 transfer fee and. It would take four to six weeks. That's trustee, the trustee processing time frame or back to back. Not a problem. Anything else I can assume.

By the way, Mary, the one that you submitted is a receipt from your debit card. Am I correct?
Speaker2 : It's from my inspired card.
Speaker1 : What we need you to submit, Mary, is an itemized bill or a final bill for this transaction. If there is any insurance involved, you need to submit an explanation of benefits. Also, Mary, we need the five essentials indicated on the bill. The patient's name, provider's name, date of service, amount of service, and the type of service. The one that you submitted to us, Mary, is incorrect. Do you have any itemized bill or final bill for this transaction? Okay, so what's wrong with the bill that I've seen you? The bill that you submit to us is a debit card receipt. We need an itemized bill or final bill for the transaction that has happened on April ten at West David's Dental P, Dallas, Texas, amounting $238.
Speaker2 : Okay, that's what, that's what I asked for and that's what they sent me.
Speaker1 : For the one, Mary, you can contact them again, ask for an itemized bill or final bill. The one that you submitted to us is incorrect. Know, you keep telling me that, but that's not going to help me why you keep repeating it. I asked for a bill and this was the only thing that they had. I mean.
Speaker2 : I don't see the difference in what you asked me. What's the difference in what you asked me, what I sent you? Can you explain to me the difference?
Speaker1 : Sure, no problem, Mary. The reason for this one or the difference of it, the one that you submitted is a debit card receipt, not an itemized bill or a final bill. There is no transaction name on it. I cannot see what transaction you purchase on your debit card on it. I can only see them now. The $348.73
Speaker2 : So it needs to say what the bill was for.
Speaker1 : Correct.
Speaker2 : Okay, that don't make sense to me, but okay, I'll try to call him back tomorrow.

Speaker2 : This number four, oh eight. 507 2415.
Speaker1 : You and how can I help you today?
Speaker2 : I am going to be going into some extended medical treatment where I will go into leave without pay status. So there won't be, you know, through my employer, the Usps, so there won't be any funds there to pay off my, you know. What I pay the Fsa each pay period. And I'm wondering How is that handled if you hit a period where they can't pay it because I don't have any paid hours, do you send me a bill? Is it back up and you take it out of another one? Can I prepay it in some way?
Speaker1 : Yeah, I'd be more than happy to assist you. So if you go on to leave without pay, what happens is the account kind of goes on a pause. And then, yeah, and then once you go back to work, it'll continue. Your payroll deductions will continue to come out. There may be one or two where they catch you up. I don't know how long you'll be off without pay. As long as
Speaker2 : Probably three months because it's cancer treatment so it's going to be.
Speaker1 : Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry. So. Where the problem lies there is if it's more than eight, If it's eight or more. Payroll deductions you go past Then the account automatically closes.
Speaker2 : Well, I've already used all the benefits, right? And that's what I'm saying. So if that were to happen, so.
Speaker1 : Let's say you were on leave without pay. Past eight pay periods, the account is closed. You've already exhausted those funds. And so when that happens. I'm not a hundred percent if you would even be liable to pay that back. After that because typically if the account is closed or you're not active with your employer, then your company kind of eats that cost, that remaining cost, if that makes sense because like normally if you retire or if you are no longer with your company anymore and you use all your funds in your flexible spending account. But let's say you use them up mid year, you know. Retire the next day. Then You're not required to pay those funds back. Your company kind of eats that cost. So I'm assuming it would be the similar. If that were to happen while you were off with leave without pay.
Speaker2 : Okay. So then, and you said that was if you miss a. Pay periods. it closes it. correct? Yes sir. automatically. So I should just do nothing then and see what happens is what I'm getting out of this.
Speaker1 : Yes, sir. So now, I mean, if you return to work. Before those eight pay periods. Like if you have run off of four or five pay periods, then yes, when you return to work, they'll reevaluate it and adjust it to. Get you caught up for the remainder of what you need to pay back. But if it goes past that eight payer periods, the account automatically closes.
Speaker2 : Okay, okay, so if I, for instance, if I'm off September, October, November, come back December and I'm working full time again. Just say that were the case. Then the amount that I am having taken out now, they would readjust that. To almost three times that amount just to catch up missing payments over a month. December. Okay, so I don't really need to do anything and just see how this plays out.

Speaker1 : Thank you. And how can I assist you today?
Speaker2 : Yes, I called a couple of days ago and. I'm not sure who I spoke to. Can you see if there's any notes? They were supposed to release the fold on my Inspire card. They were going to do like a one time emergency. Removal because I had to pick up some medication. And go to the doctors and I tried using my car today and. It was not They couldn't use it. It didn't go through.
Speaker1 : Okay, Mr., Ado, I believe you spoke with me. And I did create the hardship request. And looking right now, it does show that they did honor that. And its member has until August 11 to clear up the overpayment. Otherwise, car would be temporarily inactive again. So they did at one point. Work on that and get that done for us. So let me go on the debit card portal and see what the issue may be or maybe they forgot to turn it on. Yep, that's what it looks like. Okay.
Speaker3 : I do apologize, Mr.. Redondo. Yeah, it looks like they might have turned it on and two out of three places. So if you don't mind, can I put you on a brief one or two minute hold while I find one of my supervisors to get that turned on? I do apologize. I created the case and they said that they did it, but it doesn't look like they did. So my apologies, Mr., Hernando, bear with me one moment. Okay?
Speaker2 : Thank you. Thank you.
Speaker3 : Hello, Mr.. Redondo.
Speaker2 : Yes, I thank you very much for your patience and I do apologize for the inconvenience. Miss Ado. I'm not sure what happened, but we went ahead and turned that on and I did double check just to make sure that he did.
Speaker3 : And it is turned on and the 02:20 07:56 is available if you want to go ahead and try to pay for that again.
Speaker2 : Okay, I'll go right now and.
Speaker3 : I did want to tell you while I was waiting on them to flip that I did double check on the $50 overpayment. I do show that you submitted. A picture of the receipt, but that receipt they're not going to accept Mr. Ordos to be that it. And it needs to include their name, Haj. It needs to include the patient name, which would be you or one of your dependents, the date of service, type of service, and then the amount that you're responsible for, because that really doesn't show what you were actually paying the $50 for. So if you could ask them for an itemized receipt and that way you can get that submitted, Otherwise. Those two copies of the receipt, I'm pretty sure they're going to get denied because it's missing the majority of the.
Speaker2 : Is that the only thing I have or is there something else?
Speaker3 : Let's take a look. Hold on. That
Speaker2 : Health care reimbursement guard like this one.
Speaker3 : Yeah, let me just double check. Yeah, it looks like that's the only thing that shows us Penny at this point is just that one, that $100.01. It looks like that one was already taken care of. Because it only shows that the overpayment is for $50.
Speaker2 : Okay, I'll call the dentist and ask him for an item. My receipt. Perfect. I just wanted to give you a heads up, Mr..
Speaker3 : Yeah. When they go to look for it again. And turn it off on the 11th because I think that that's when they said they're going to go and look. And they're giving you until the 11th. So as long as that's clear by then, they'll keep that debit card on. Okay.
Speaker2 : Okay, is there anything else that I can assist you with today, Miss? No, that'll be all. Thank you. You're welcome. And again, I do apologize for the inconvenience of you having to call us back.

Thank you for Texan and may I please have your name?
Speaker2 : My name is Leo.
Speaker1 : Oh, Leo, Leo. may I have your full name? Mr.. Leo. Oh yes, sorry, Leonel Flores. All right, thank you. And also may I have your address?
Speaker2 : It's 1202 Kenna Lily Lane, Plug Ville, texas 78660.
Speaker1 : Thank you. And also, Matt, have a call that telephone number.
Speaker2 : 512401. 7152.
Speaker1 : Okay, thank you. And to secure your account, we have the last four digits of your Tex Flex debit card, Mr.. Forrest.
Speaker2 : Let me get it. I believe it's 5470, but let me check. Not even close. Sorry, it's 3247.
Speaker1 : Okay, thank you. How may I help you today?
Speaker2 : I was calling because I got a notice that my account had been suspended and wanted to find out about that and get it unlocked.
Speaker1 : Alright, you had a debit card charge. Four $234 and 66 Cents For Easy Contacts Showing here that $11.95 Information required I don't have a copy of your documentation, so it looks like $220.
Speaker2 : So Just to kind of give you an idea because you probably see it there. But what I'm thinking happened is I purchased some glasses, but I also returned them, but when I returned them, they didn't refund the shipping. And so that's probably what the difference is. Because it shows that there was a refund, I believe, on the 30th, right?
Speaker1 : Of $221.71, right
Speaker2 : And so I guess they locked my whole account. For the difference, right? Oh, okay. of $11.95 because they only refunded the 02:22 71.
Speaker1 : So we would need the itemized receipt for the $11.95.
Speaker2 : Yeah, they didn't refund it, so I need to pay that. right.
Speaker1 : Right.
Speaker2 : How would I make that payment?
Speaker1 : So to return the funds back to your account, you can. Log in to your online account. And you go up on urgent action needed and it'll give you the option to pay back account.
Speaker2 : Okay, and does it have that amount invoice somewhere or do I need to say, do I need to give an exact amount? Okay, okay. no, it's going to show $11.95. Okay, okay.
Speaker1 : $0.05
Speaker2 : Okay, good. So I'll just make that payment online, but how long does it take to unlock?
Speaker1 : Once you make that payment, it could take 24 to 48 h for your card to be reinstated.
Speaker2 : Okay. Now the other question that I had is like I returned those glasses, but I ordered some contacts. Do I need to submit a receipt for that or was that verified?
Speaker1 : For the $163.18 contacts direct, right? Yes, we need the itemized receipt for that. Showing Provider, patient date, Service contact lenses and then of course the amount. Yes. so we need the receipt for that as well.
Speaker2 : And I can just upload that on the website also.
Speaker1 : On the website you're going to see it under. Verify car purchase. that'll give you the option to upload documents.
Speaker2 : Okay, good, good. All right, Well, that's what I needed to find out.
Speaker1 : Okay. Right, Mr., Flores. anything else I can assist you with today?
Speaker2 : No, that's it. Thank you.

I can't see the document I submitted on your website, so I can't tell. But I don't know. What I need to do to resolve this because it wasn't prepaid. I think what I submitted was a treatment plan that wasn't an actual invoice.

Speaker2 : Not at all. I appreciate your help.
Speaker1 : Of course, I'll be right back with you. Thank you for your patience, Mr.. Smalley. So I do see that. Yes, it was the treatment plan that was uploaded to the. Receipt request within the member portal. So that's why we were not able to substantiate the request. We would need the receipt or explanation of benefits showing that the service has already been rendered.
Speaker2 : Okay. Do I have Do I still have time to do that?
Speaker1 : Yes, there is still time to get that uploading and the request should still be visible in your member portal, both on the dashboard and underneath the support claims slash receipts tab. Yeah, I see that I can substitute. I just wanted to make sure it didn't expire or something like that. So.
Speaker2 : I'll contact the provider and have them send me another copy of the receipt so that I can submit that. All right.

Speaker3 : Thank you so much for that information. Allow me to double check here the document that you sent to us. And then why is it they denied the. Approval, I can get an updated one. That one is from the original when I created the account. I mean, if I need to get a new one, I can.
Speaker2 : I can
Speaker3 : Okay, actually sir, I see it here. The document that you sent last. July 29. This is a document regarding with the $195, right? This is the letter of medical necessity.

Speaker3 : Let me double check here for the denied information. Okay? Be okay if I go, please hold for three to 5 min. Thank you so much.
Speaker1 : Hello Miss Omar. Thank you for patiently holding. Yes, I already double the document. actually, sir, it was reviewed already by our back in office. So when I double check the Lom that you sent to us. There are some instances that there is an information should be have to diagnose. So I double check there is already a diagnose duration of the treatment. There is also explanation as to why it is medically necessity or necessary the doctor's name signature and the patient's name. So as per checking here the information on your Ln. The signature of the provider. Is not showing on the Lm that you sent to us.
Speaker2 : Okay. I'll get that.
Speaker1 : You can also download the Ln to our website so that there is already the information there. It's just like your Dr., just need to fill in the information. Just kindly visit our website on the www. dot inspire financial.com and then kindly go to documents and in form, then click administrative form and then find the L M N.
Speaker2 : Yeah. I can just upload the document like I did. Right? And that'll go to you guys the way I did it before. Yes.
Speaker1 : Okay. That
Speaker2 : Right. Yeah, okay. I just don't understand how it's been good all this time and now all of a sudden it's not. So I know it's not you in particular, but this is kind of why the flex spending account is a pain in the ass and it's sometimes not worth it. But yeah, I'll take care of it and I'll get that signature from the Dr., that I guess isn't on there. And. I'll upload the document.
Speaker1 : Thank you so much. And by the way, our back in office, we're going to review the documents within three to five business days. Okay.
Speaker2 : Okay, do you know when they're going to turn my account off or whatever? The threat is that I'm not going to be able to use my money or whatever. Do you know, am I like in danger of like tomorrow?
Speaker1 : Let me double check with that one. Have you received? For checking, sir, you have not yet received a notification regarding for the deactivation of the car because we are sending a notification 1st that is for notify the account holder to substantiate the amount in question. There is a 1st warning. There is also 2nd warning that we can send another notification if there is no action for the amount in question. And the 3rd Mail that you were going to receive is the activation on the 2nd letter that you were going to receive. So there's indication there that on this certain date the card will be temporarily inactive.

Speaker1 : I just recently separated from my employer and my coverage was till the end of the month, which is today, and I wanted to get a Cobra coverage for a couple of months.
Speaker2 : Sure, I'll be happy to help with that. Let me get your account pulled up and see what I can help you with here. And have you received your Cobra packet yet?
Speaker1 : I have not. That's why I'm calling because I, from past experience, I know I don't get it until quite a bit after.
Speaker2 : Okay. And do you have access to the inspire final.com website?
Speaker1 : I don't think so. I was on the Aetna site, but I did. Not for the inspired
Speaker2 : Okay. Reason why I was asking is because you can either enroll online or you can pull the paperwork off the website where you can fax, email, or mail it to us. Is there a good callback number for you for any questions or concerns as well?
Speaker1 : 442 8920 03:10
Speaker2 : Thank you. So I heard 440-28-9231.
Speaker1 : Correct.
Speaker2 : Thank you. Let's see when that packet was mailed here. Looks like the packet was mailed on July 22 of 2025. See what we have here. So that was just last week, so you should be receiving it any time. Let me get that packet pulled up here. You can also register your account online where you can look at your account online as well if you want to. You can. you would just have to register with your member number, which looks like it is your social scanner with no dashes. Okay, Is that what Inspire.com? Aspira financial.com. It looks like the last day to enroll is September 30 of 2025 is what it says.
Speaker1 : That was the question. Like If something happens where I need it in the meantime between say tomorrow when my insurance. Is done from my work. And I got till the September 30. Am I still covered?
Speaker2 : So effective you start date of August 1, 2025 is what the start date is. You won't show coverage after tonight.
Speaker1 : Explain that again.
Speaker2 : So the start date of the Cobra plan is August 1 of 2025. So your previously employer will cut off your benefits as of midnight tonight. And then as of August 1, you won't show coverage until you enroll and make your premium payment.
Speaker1 : Okay, see that's what I was, you know, they sent it the 22nd. I haven't got it yet. so, you know, as of midnight I'm not covered. That's, that's what was. Frustrating about this
Speaker2 : Right, It does retro back to the loss of coverage date and the employer has 30 days to notify us. So they're within
Speaker1 : I just didn't want to if I didn't have the. You know. Like I said, but I don't, I'm not covered until I actually sign up.
Speaker2 : Right. Okay, yes, and it looks like here generally how it works is once you enroll and make your initial premium payment, eligibility can take up to ten business days since it retro is back to that loss of coverage date too, just to let you know.
Speaker1 : So I'm not covered as soon as I make the payment.
Speaker2 : It may take up to ten business days even if a payment has been made. It goes by the carriers themselves how they update. Some of them start the updating on the date of the actual date of Cobra, which would be the 1st. Some of them do. Update when we send the payment information. And since the payment you're making it today. It's possible that you won't be covered for up to the ten business days.
Speaker1 : I could have two weeks with no health coverage is what they're saying.
Speaker2 : Right.
Speaker1 : That doesn't seem fair.
Speaker2 : You're not the only one that goes through this. Anybody that signs up for Cobra does go through it.
Speaker1 : Well, that means. There's something wrong with it.
Speaker2 : But it does retro back. You would have coverage if something did come up.
Speaker1 : Okay, so. It goes back to the day I left work. So if I had to pay something out of pocket, it would reimburse me.
Speaker2 : Out of pocket
Speaker1 : Well, If something happened. Within that ten days. It would go back and cover it, you're saying.
Speaker2 : Yes, out of pocket or denied claims goes to the insurance carriers themselves.
Speaker1 : Okay. I'm on the website. What do I need to go? I does it manage benefits account log in?
Speaker2 : Right. And it looks like your medical is $979.39 a month just to let you know too.
Speaker1 : Okay.
Speaker2 : And then the dental is $34.45 a month.
Speaker1 : Can I waive that the dental and the vision.
Speaker2 : Yes, you can only if you only want the medical, you can, you don't have, you just have to decline what the coverage is.
Speaker1 : Okay.
Speaker2 : Yes.
Speaker1 : I'm on the site, so. As long as they're mailing it to me and as long as I'm covered in retro, that's mainly what I'm worried about. I don't trust my luck.
Speaker2 : Sure. Yes, you would be covered. You would be covered because it retro is back. You'll be fine.
Speaker1 : Okay, all right. I'm going to say I'm going to fill this out. I have any other issues I'll call back. Thank you very much. I'm sorry I got impatient with you. No, don't be sorry. I understand anything else I can answer for you today. No, that's good. Thank you. Thanks Call Inspire Financial. We appreciate your business and you have a good day. Take care. Thank you. Thank you.

Speaker1 : Okay, thanks for holding I am back.
Speaker2 : Okay, you're welcome. So it looks like, yes, it did go through.

However, I did check the account is in normal status, the access indicator is on, and there's no notes from fraud. So. I don't see any reason on our end as to why that card will would not work when she goes to the Dr., later.

Speaker1 : 267 8849228.
Speaker2 : Thank you for that, Mr.. Randall. I just need to repeat the number 267-88-4922 08:00 a.m., I correct.
Speaker1 : Yes.
Speaker2 : Thank you. And how can I help?
Speaker1 : I was calling because I had a. I had, I had. I had made A request for I put a claim in, I'm sorry, I'm trying to get the language right. I put a claim in for. To get some money taken out of my account. And it said that it was deposited on the 29th. And it still hasn't shown up in my account yet. Usually it only take a day. Because it's direct deposit.
Speaker2 : Let me just check here, sir, on the information about the claim that you submitted. And may I know what is the amount on that so that they can check it here?
Speaker1 : So originally I submitted the claim for $300, but I believe the 1st. I only had 250. $257.69 in my account. So when I go to claims, they say that. It said that the amount requested was $288.45. And they say the amount paid was 02:57 and $0.69.
Speaker2 : Let me just check it here. What you requested here, sir, the $288.45. am I correct?
Speaker1 : Yes. That's the claim. The claim number And then 2318. The claim Id number
Speaker2 : Okay, let me just check it here. Just give me at least a minute or two, sir. I just need to scan the account. 1st. Is it okay?
Speaker1 : Okay.
Speaker2 : Okay, so they just released the funds for you, the $257.69, because the available balance before is $257.69. So for the remaining amount. So let us calculate the remaining amount for the 280 eights and $0.45. One moment.
Speaker1 : $30 and 7070 $0.06
Speaker2 : Okay. Yeah, $30.76. So you need to wait for the another contribution on your account and that's the time we can reimburse the remaining of the $288.45, which is the $30.76 because on the dependent care account there is an amount that is contributing on your account and that's the time. Also we can release the funds if there is already an available balance. So as of the moment there is still no additional contribution. So we can release the remaining if there is already a contribution on your account.
Speaker1 : No, I understand that. I was just wondering. you said that the 250, the $257.69, it was just released like as in today. Or it was released on the 29th.
Speaker2 : Okay, so it was already released on July 29, 2025. So please allow us three to five business days to be sent over on your. Bank account So we already sent over. July 2920 25. But we have a process date or the time frame for three to five business days to be posted on your. Bank account Okay, so I just check it here. So if we released it on 29 or on the bank account that you have, so it might be. You will receive the funds by Upcoming week. Next week, sir. If it is under three to five business days.
Speaker1 : Right. Okay.
Speaker2 : You just need to wait, sir, on your bank account to receive the $257.69.
Speaker1 : So at the earliest it could come tomorrow, but at the latest it'll come Monday or Tuesday.
Speaker2 : Yes, sir, that is the maximum based on the business days that we have.
Speaker1 : All right, thank you.
Speaker2 : You're welcome. And aside from this, is there anything else I can assist Mr.? Randall?
Speaker1 : No, that's it. That's all. It just never took this long for the money to get deposited in my account. Like I don't, this is, this is a very long, like it never took this long. When they say pay, they usually be in my account the next day. But I mean, I got to wait so it's fine.
Speaker2 : Okay sir, so I really do apologize. And on that delay, that upcoming, it might be because of a high volume of claims that we receive and the process time on putting on the bank accounts also got delayed. I really do apologize about it, sir. And aside from this, is there anything else?
Speaker1 : No, that's it.
Speaker2 : Okay, so thank you for calling Inspire Financial and have a great day, Mr.. Randall.

Speaker1 : Even if it's like when you check in for your appointment because you know you have to pay a copay, this is a copy thing.
Speaker2 : Yes, ma'am. We would still need those details to verify the transaction. Oh, okay. Then I would have to get what Kaiser in because this is what they had on their website. Oh, okay. Yes, ma'am, or of course contact. Your insurance carrier and try to find the explanation of benefits. The explanation of benefits is the best thing to submit.
Speaker1 : These things Okay, because it has the service date, but it says service. And it has his name as the patient and it says the health care professional not available.
Speaker2 : Yeah, we would most definitely need some sort of itemized statement for that visit or the explanation of benefits.

Speaker1 : I actually, I had questions. I never had this before, so I was just trying to figure it out. And I downloaded the app and stuff. Like, what stuff do you need to show receipts for?
Speaker2 : So it just all depends when you use the debit card, it may ask you for. To provide documentation for the receipts that you've used that you. I'm sorry, they may ask you to provide supporting documentation for the services that you received. Or for the purchase that you made. And so if they ask you for the verification, then what you provide is either a detailed statement with the patient's name, provider's name, date of service, type of service with the codes and the amounts, or an explanation of benefits from your insurance company. So it just all depends.
Speaker1 : Well, like I picked up like they would reach out to me though, like if I needed that.
Speaker2 : Right. Absolutely.
Speaker1 : And it went through fine. I didn't see anything like my scripts came through fine. But then I wanted to pay my dentist bill and I was like, I wonder what I do for this. That's what I was trying to really figure out. That's what I was about to do.
Speaker2 : Same with the dentist. Now with dentists typically you're going to get. You will get a notice to provide documentation only because. It takes Anywhere from three to six weeks to get the explanation of benefits. And sometimes the dental office will give you a guesstimate amount and they'll have guesstimate insurance funds. so it's not actual. So what we'll do is request an actual detailed statement once the insurance has paid their portion or an explanation of benefits to show exactly what your out of pocket expense was for that service.
Speaker1 : So like if I went to my dentist now, I could use the card to pay the bill and then. That and then like provide them with the right Like with the right Explanation receipts
Speaker2 : Right now, we don't want receipts to show how much you paid with a detailed statement or explanation of benefits from your insurance provider. Yes, ma'am. So that's. As long as it's within your plan year. So it looks like your plan year is from. July 2025 up until June 2000, June 30, 2026. So you want to make sure that it's within those plans. So if you've been there previously and if you have a balance. It wouldn't take care of that balance. It's not valid. Absolutely. Same with vision. when you go to the eye, Dr.. Their documents that they provide you after your services is pretty much legit. So if they ask for that, you can retrieve that. Now the protection plan is not valid. So if you pay for that, you'll be responsible to either pay it back or to offset it with some out of pocket expenses. But other than that, the vision is pretty much. Actual so you can admit that claim and you'll be fine. But the dental, I would wait until after the explanation of benefits has been generated. Same with medical. So we give you typically about 56 days to provide us with documentation. You'll receive a notice within the 1st ten days stating, hey, we see you. Use your debit card. And then you'll receive a 1st letter. And then a 2nd letter and then the 3rd letter will deactivate your debit card if you don't provide the correct information.
Speaker1 : Okay, okay, okay. And do you have the Inspired? Absolutely. Do you have the Inspire financial online account? Yeah, I actually, I downloaded the app and then I was trying to, we never really got like anything that explains it all. You know what I mean? I don't know, so I was trying to look on there and read through it, but I wanted to make sure before I mess something up.
Speaker2 : Absolutely. no, that we understand totally. And you can always call in. We can help you with that. The app will give you A lot of information, but if you go into the website it kind of give you your deadlines on when you can spend how much you can. What's the last day to spend? What's the last day to file a claim? And then you can, it'll show you where you can look at the verify card purchases and then it'll give you information like if you submit a document and if it comes back to you or once it's approved. And I have a selection where you sent documents and where we sent documents so everything is available to you. But if you're not sure where to locate it, you can definitely contact us and we'll will assist you with that.
Speaker1 : Okay, thank you so much. I appreciate it.
Speaker2 : Absolutely. Is there anything else I can help you with on today?
Speaker1 : No, thank you.
Speaker2 : Okay, you're welcome. Thank you for calling Inspire Financial and have a good day.

Can you confirm your 1st and last name, please?
Speaker2 : Yep, William Brockman. All right, Mr., Brockman. And to continue the call, can you verify the last four digits of your inspired debit card with us? I can't, I don't have it handy.
Speaker1 : No worries. Do you possibly know maybe a recent transaction that you've done in the last three business days or your last paycheck date and the contribution amount if you don't know that?
Speaker2 : I know the contribution amount is $50. Per paycheck. I don't know when. My last payment out of there was.
Speaker1 : When was your last paycheck? Was it last week or you get paid by week? It would have been.
Speaker2 : The beginning of July. Very end of June. It could be, it could be a little messy on my end because. I've been on paternity leave. So I'm kind of getting paid in a funky way right now.
Speaker1 : Understood, but you can confirm there hasn't been any transaction within the last three business days, correct?
Speaker2 : No, there has not. I think the account is suspended.
Speaker1 : Okay, I can verify that. And how can I help out today?
Speaker2 : Yeah, so I was trying to, I was logged in this morning and I was trying to find. The info on this I had seen a few weeks ago, maybe like an email or something. I can't remember that said. The account was suspended and it was I think primarily due to like maybe a single charge. To Brookwood Baptist Health for I think it's like $600 or $603. And I wanted, but I was going in there today to see, I kind of verify what that charge was when it was and also so I can go back to the hospital and get. I guess get a receipt or something for it to verify the expense. But now I'm not seeing that today. Can you verify that that is? What's holding the account up right now or is there anything else that's holding the account of?
Speaker1 : Yes, sir. So it is just that $603.75 from January 24 that we need that documentation from. Was insurance bill during this data service.
Speaker2 : I would assume so, but I don't know for sure. I'm trying to remember exactly what that service was for. I think it was a. I think it was for an Er visit. For my spouse.
Speaker1 : It may be easier going to your insurance carrier's website and getting the E. Yes, sir. It's just a single charge.
Speaker2 : Okay. So, and I'm sorry, what would you say is kind of the best course of action? Yes, if you didn't want to have to go up to the hospital to get the itemized receipt, if you think insurance may have been billed around that time frame of January 24 of this year, you can look on your insurance carrier's website for the explanation of benefits. We can accept that as well. Okay, so if I go to my insurance providers, Aetna, so if I go find on there. Where they were Charged or billed for that date as well. I can export that to you guys.
Speaker1 : That is correct. Yes, sir.
Speaker2 : Okay, but otherwise if I can't find that, it would just be a matter of. Getting a receipt from the hospital.
Speaker1 : Correct the itemized receipt. It must have of course their name on it, the patient's name, the date of service, the amount, and of course a description as to what was done. As long as all five things are on there, then you can submit that to verify as well. ST.
Speaker2 : Okay, and once all that's done, the account should get freed up. Is that right?
Speaker1 : That is correct. Once you send in the documents, if you upload it, that would be the quickest way. It takes three to five business days to process those documents, and then within 24 to 48 h, your card will be turned back on.
Speaker2 : Okay, hey, while I have you, I've another question and maybe you can answer this. Maybe you can't, I'm not sure, but I'm a relatively new employee at Jp Morgan and I know that we also have the ability to receive kind of additional funds into the Mra account through completing certain wellness activities or. Regular doctor's visits and things like that. How does that typically work for like let's say doctor's visits? Like if I go get a physical. Do I need to myself upload some kind of confirmation that I did that? To your website to get credited or do I do that through the Jp Morgan portal? Do you know?
Speaker1 : Well, I don't really know a lot about the wellness incentives, but I do know for a fact that Cigna is over the wellness incentives and it is how. Basically, your provider submits the claim. If you want more information, I can definitely give you their number. So you can give them a call just to see if there's a certain code that the provider has to put in so you can make sure you get those funds. Or, you know, they just see the claim and then see that it was for maybe an annual visit and they just apply the funds to your account. Would you like their number? And I can get you over if you have time.
Speaker2 : No, I think I got. so Sigma is kind of the administrator of that program. You guys are. Okay, understood. No, I've got their info. I can follow up with them on that later.
Speaker1 : Okay. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
Speaker2 : I don't think so. I will try to Find that information online and get it uploaded to hopefully get that thing freed up as soon as possible.
Speaker1 : Yes, sir, we'll be looking out for that. Mr., Brockman, I hope you have a lovely day if nothing else. Okay.

Speaker0 : Hi M. Pittman, thank you so much for waiting through that hold with me today so I was able to see what the decline reason was for the card.
Speaker2 : It looks like this is declining. For not being in the inventory system. So with pharmacies, one of the ways that the card works with pharmacies is it leans on an internal inventory system to know what's eligible under the flexible spending account or health savings account. And Sometimes With merchants, they may either So it could be one of two. Things that are going on here. It could be that the pharmacy itself doesn't have the internal inventory system set up showing what is eligible and what's not eligible. But it could also be That that item just isn't coded correctly in their inventory system.
Speaker1 : Okay, so it's on their end, not mine.
Speaker2 : Right. Yes, ma'am, if you wouldn't mind. If you wouldn't mind divulging What specifically is the item that you're trying to purchase today? It's a weight loss medication. Oh, okay. So I have a prescription for it and everything. and I tried to go through my insurance and they wanted to charge me $1300. So this is a generic form. Right, right. Okay. So yes, ma'am. So prescriptions include all prescriptions, including the weight loss medications. Those are all considered eligible. It used to be that weight loss prescriptions required a letter of medical necessity, but that hasn't changed. What I would advise to do is if you do have to request. If you do have to pay out of pocket, I would definitely advise to go online. And go through the request funds process so that way you can be reimbursed. Now I would just recommend like taking a screenshot of the itemized receipt that you get from making the purchase just in case you're requested for the documentation later. We don't request documentation within Fire for health savings accounts, but when you go to file your taxes and you submit that 1099 Sax document. The Irs may request documentation and just because I'm not sure of what the circumstances are that causes them to ask for documentation, I just tell everybody with an Hsa account to save the documentation just in case.
Speaker1 : Okay, sounds good.
Speaker2 : Okay. Was there anything else that I could do to assist you today while I had you here on the phone with me or any other questions that you may be able to think while I have you here? No, I'm just.
Speaker1 : Recapping something isn't coded correctly on their end to process the card. Correct. That's all I need to tell them. Right, right. Yes, ma'am. Is that it's showing up as not being eligible essentially. Okay, that's all I need.
Speaker2 : All right. well, I hope that you have a wonderful rest of your day, Mrs., Pittman, and I hope that you have a great weekend to look forward to as well. You too. Thank you.

Speaker2 : Yes.
Speaker1 : All right, thank you so much for that information. And how can I assist B?
Speaker2 : I got an email saying that there were some fraudulent charges on my account and then I looked at the transactions and it looked like there were multiple. Amazon transactions that went through that they weren't they didn't go through, they were blocked but they weren't from me.
Speaker1 : Okay, so they're not your charge.
Speaker2 : No, they're not my charges. Okay, thank you. I'm on that.
Speaker1 : And just to go over them. Just like all of them are from Amazon Marketplace for $147.45. On today
Speaker2 : Yes, none of those are for me.
Speaker1 : Okay, I'm going to send this over to the frog department. Bear with me one moment. So let me tell you the process of what's going to happen. So I'm sending it over to the fire department to let them know these are not your charges. I will then be getting you over to our debit card team. What they're going to do is cancel out your card and get you a new card sent out to you and. They'll move forward from there if they need to get you over to the actual Umb bank, but it's not a guarantee that you'll have had to go over there. Okay, so bear with me one moment. I'm putting in this sending over this email to the fraud department to let them know that these are not your charges and then I'll get you over to our debit card team.
Speaker2 : Okay, thank you.
Speaker1 : Yes, sir. Do you mind if I place you on a brief hold?
Speaker2 : No, that's okay.
Speaker1 : Thank you so much. One moment please. All right, thank you so much for holding. I apologize about that hold. So I did speak with our debit card team. They were able to, they did order you a new card, allow ten to 15 business days for your new card to arrive. However, with the charges, since they are still just showing pending on the account, we have to wait until they clear on there so they can start the dispute process. Okay, so once you see them. Not pending on your account anymore gives us a call back so we can start that process. It's already notated in your account that you will be calling back.
Speaker2 : Okay, I'm just confused how they even got my information because I've never even used that debit card. Like I've never swiped it. I've never entered it in anywhere. so it's weird that it got hacked.
Speaker1 : I have no idea, honestly. We've been seeing a lot when it comes to the Amazon marketplace, so they take that very seriously. But honestly, I do not know how they get your information.
Speaker2 : Okay. Okay, so I'll have to call back after they're not pending anymore.
Speaker1 : Yes, sir.
Speaker2 : Okay. Well, thank you for your help. Is there like. A case number that I should reference when I call back or anything.
Speaker1 : It's not. Let me see, did she put a. I mean, let me see, did she put a ticket number here?
Speaker0 : Yeah.
Speaker1 : I don't see a ticket number. But no, your account is. Fully Notated so we'll know exactly what you're speaking of when you call back and I have put everything in the notes here. As well. Okay, and then I also want to confirm did they lock the card so they won't be able to make any more charges? The card is turned completely off. You'll just be waiting on your new card.
Speaker2 : Okay, great. Yes, sir.

And at the time, I don't know, something happened from the Etna and they erase my medical was like, and I talked to them and I get back. My medical and dental last week but I had the vision but I have some problem in June and I went to the men clinic. And they sent me You know, bill 03:30 09:32 So I have the question, you know, at the time, I don't have the medical, something happened from the Etna and they wear it, but I had the vision at the time. So can I still use the Fs card for the bill?
Speaker2 : Okay, let me take a look here.
Speaker0 : This is 03:30 09:32
Speaker2 : Well, it doesn't show any break in coverage in your flexible spending account.
Speaker0 : You don't have enough in there to cover the entire bill.
Speaker1 : How much I have in there.
Speaker0 : I am showing a balance of 500. Well, actually you do. I guess I was looking at the. I was looking at a different balance. You have $500.03 in the account, but did you say that the bill was from last year was from 05:31 or from May? I mean.
Speaker1 : Yeah, I give it to them. Yeah, I paid back that one. 05:31. No, it's like, oh, okay, so I can use it for this, you know, for the vision. 03:30 09:32.
Speaker2 : You can't use the card because of the data service. What you need to understand is that Cbs's benefits don't run on a calendar year. They run on a fiscal year. So benefit periods run June 1 through May 31. Anything that happened prior to May 31, or I should say June 1 of this year? Will be part of last plan years. So you can't use your card because it would pull out of the current year. However. You do have part of that $500 is $240 that was left in last year that carried over to this year.
Speaker1 : Oh, okay.
Speaker2 : So you can file a claim on the website and at least get part of it back, but you won't be able to get all of it.
Speaker1 : Okay. Okay, so we need to call the 8th number and find out. And I have one more question, you know. You know, I have to do my dental thing because I have a lot of problems in my dental. And Because I talked to the doctors so it's like a lot of money and I want to do in my country is going to be cheaper over there.
Speaker0 : So can I withdraw some money from the Fsa card so I can use that money from like in my country because I know we can't use our medical insurance over there and Fsa card over there.
Speaker1 : So can I withdraw some money from the card and I can do my dental thing in my country because it's going to be cheaper there.
Speaker2 : You can't withdraw funds from the Fsa. The only way to get the funds out of there is to use the card or file a claim. But if you do go ahead and spend the money over there to get the work done, you can submit the receipts when you get back and you can get reimbursed for it.
Speaker1 : Okay, from Fsa A, right? Yeah, from F S A. Okay, but I can't withdraw the money. right? Before I'm going to go there.
Speaker2 : Yeah, you can't just withdraw it, unfortunately. I just like, I know I'm going to come back. I can't claim. Okay. Yeah, so I have to show the bill.

So is there any other question you would like to ask while I'm still on the line?
Speaker2 : No, so I mean. The question that I wanted that is not clarified, right? Do I need a pin or no? Do I need a four digit pin when I swipe the card?
Speaker3 : When I swipe the card. Oh, I see. You are asking if you need to have your pin to swipe the card. Is that correct? Correct.
Speaker1 : Thank you so much for confirming. All right, so with regards to that one. If it's required to have your pen, then you can go ahead and input your Pin. I just want to set for expectation that. Your Pin, it is the last four digits of your card. That's the default Pin. You can also try to swipe the card as a credit or debit.
Speaker2 : So no, so the premium is not mandatory is what I'm asking. I can just. Give it to the Dr., the pain is not mandatory. Can just swipe the card right without the Pin as well. Or is the Pin mandatory? is my question.
Speaker1 : To have it clarified. If it's required you to encode a Pin, then you can encode your Pin, which is the last four digits of your debit card. But if it's not required, then you can use the card or swipe the card automatically a credit or debit. And let's say in. I do apologize for cutting you off. I would like to set up expectation as well that in a scenario where in the card transaction will be declined, then you can go ahead and request funds under your online portal. For requesting funds, there's no need for you to submit any type of documentation. However, for your out of pocket expenses, please keep those receipts in case the Irs will do a random adit. Okay.
Speaker2 : So sorry, I didn't understand. Why would you're saying if the funds run out over 345 is what you're saying? Then only I will get a message. Fine, that's okay. I just want to utilize the $345, nothing more than that. Yes, you're correct. Thank you very much. Have a nice day.
Speaker1 : You're welcome. It has been a pleasure. Thank you so much for calling Inspire Financial. Have a great one and keep safe.

Speaker1 : Yes, all right, how may I help you today? Well, I'm trying to figure out. How to enroll in this here. I know what I told East Penn when I left there, what I wanted, but I don't. And then it just has like. On the 1st page here, it has like you put your Social Security number for Cobra continued. Health care and enrollment And then it says, enclosed is my check and you're supposed to put an amount there. I wasn't sure if I was going to mail everything in just because I don't like doing everything online. So What I told them I was going to do was the Capital Blue, the Cbc P P. Number two mid and that was $197 and then with their discount at East Penn. It was $79.50 that comes off of there. So then I would have to pay $117.50 for that. But I also told them that I was going to enroll in the. Dental, but I didn't remember how much that was. If I had sent that to you too for the dental.
Speaker2 : Okay, so. If you're looking at your page, on the top right hand corner are page numbers. If you look at page 3952.
Speaker1 : Oh wait, 39. I don't even 3952. Okay, that's in the back here. 3952. Oh, okay. 39 two. okay.
Speaker2 : Those are the plans that your company is offering. I know you said the Pp2, but I'm showing Pp1.
Speaker1 : Yeah, I see that. But why does it have a monthly premium? $930. That's what it is. monthly. Huh? What I have That's what they told you that I wanted.
Speaker2 : I mean, that's what, that's the file they sent over to us. We're not an insurance company. We don't sell insurance. So whatever what the employer sends to us, that's what we. Offer And then they tell us what to charge and that's what they put on there. Nine three 63.
Speaker1 : What is that? Mine has $197. Why would I pay? $930 for. Are they offering you a subsidy like a severance pay? Well, that was only $79. That's what I'm telling you. The Pp2 that I picked up there that I told him that I wanted and that there at the bottom it says $197 and then de' discount that they said that I could have was. $79.50 So I figured I owe $117.50 And then when I saw this here, I saw that, but I thought, well, that ain't right.
Speaker2 : Well, you'll need to do is call your employer and have them send over a new file because that's what they sent us.
Speaker1 : Okay, well that's all wrong because that's not even close to, I don't know why it would be. That's like a whole, oh my god, the ball game here, that's not even close to what I thought that. Okay, I'll have to call them. Okay. All right. Anything else that I can help you with today?

Speaker1 : For the amount of 175 And it got denied from what I can hear.
Speaker2 : Yes, all right, I can see here.
Speaker1 : I see. The reason why it got denied for the claim, Bruce is that prepaid expenses and or pretreatment estimates are not eligible for reimbursement. Our backend team requests to submit the explanation of benefit or the itemized bill. After you have received the services. May I know what happened with this type of transaction? Have you already received the service?
Speaker2 : Of course I did. It's not a prepaid. You pay it up front. That's why I have the receipt. I don't know what you guys understand about a receipt. When you get a receipt, that means the transaction or. The service has already been done. It's a coronary calcium couch. I didn't know what you guys don't understand. You have to ask your medical professionals for you, for you to be able to understand this. I don't know what three be what you're talking about.
Speaker1 : I actually am looking at the document that you have submitted right now and from what I can see here, the $175 that has been charged. For you with your A Ct heart or calcium score has an estimated responsibility of another $75. That's the reason why we are requesting you to submit the explanation of benefits. However, this has been covered by your insurance provider.
Speaker2 : Insurance does not cover it. You can ask it. Now. I have been coming back and forth trying to argue with them, This is a preventive thing. But then they went to call the Dr., but I didn't know why in the heck in the world this is a preventive for me. I consider it preventive. You do that, You do that Ct scan, you do that Mri. To see If you have calcium deposits in That way you can prevent from having a heart attack. I do not know what Or other companies Yeah, I will continue to push through with this thing. Because this is very necessary. And I don't know why insurance does not cover that.
Speaker1 : Okay, I totally understand.
Speaker2 : I don't have no time for you to go back and forth. So okay. What have you, what have you for me to say?
Speaker1 : All right, now what I'm going to do here is since I understand that you have lack of time today, will you be able to request for the final billing statement for this transaction and that way you can upload it again?
Speaker2 : I didn't know what is the final billing statement you're asking. This is a payment up front. They will not do that city calcium score if you do not pay it upfront. I don't know why you don't understand by the receipt.
Speaker1 : The receipt that you provided shows an estimate responsibility for your insurance. That's the reason why it got denied now. For this to push through and for this to go through with regard to the claim, since you've paid upfront using your Inspired or Pay Flex debit card.
Speaker2 : I did not use my Ins spiral. I paid my cash. I paid mine with my debit card. They won't accept in spiral. Do you see the number on the receipt? Did it say, do you understand? By the way, what's your name? Does it say there I use the inspired? They do not. they do not recognize inspired. They're not accepting that. That is the thing.

So I'm not sure why the doctor's office would say that. So I would say, reach out to your carrier, find out. Or call back and ask them where they're getting that information from because. You have all your shows on all your paperwork that it's not ending. so something is going wrong on their systems most likely.

Speaker1 : Thank you. Okay, so the last representative stated that you were calling because you're no longer with the employer and you wanted to know if you could still use the account. Is that correct?
Speaker2 : Actually, no, I had an Hsa card, which supposedly is this card that I have here, and it had funds that they have taken from my check for medical expenses, but I. Kind of like put it aside and never thought of it. And I found this card. I know I never used those funds. I wanted to know what had happened to the funds on that card. But now I found out that there is an Ira apparently on this as well. So I don't really know what's going on. I no longer work with them, so I don't know what's happening.
Speaker1 : Okay, so you're trying to figure out what happened to the funds that were on the card.
Speaker2 : Yes, and then what is this about an Ira? I was not aware of that either.
Speaker1 : Okay. Just a 2nd
Speaker2 : Okay.
Speaker1 : Okay, you said you had an H S A account.
Speaker2 : Yes, that's as far as I knew it was an Hsa account. But the part that I have An account I show you had an Fsa account but not an Hsa account. What Fsa Okay, it must be that one.
Speaker1 : Yes. So when you're no longer working with the employer. That is forfeited.
Speaker2 : So I lose that money. The employer owes the account. Yes, because the employer owns that account. But that's money that was taken out of my check. So that means it was my money.
Speaker1 : Yes, ma'am, I understand. But an Fsa account is an employer owned account. An Hsa is an account that you own. Regardless of what job you go to, you'll still have that account. But the Fsa is not the same. So once you. Leave that employer, the account is forfeited. It's currently showing me that the account is permanently inactive and there's a $0 balance.
Speaker2 : Okay. It don't matter, it was just $50. They sold so much for me. So what is now about the Ira account? What is going on with that that I didn't know about?
Speaker1 : Let's see, I don't show that you have an Ira account. I just show that you had. An Fsa account and then you had a dependent care account. It's not showing you have any other account.
Speaker2 : The other representative told me that she saw an Ira account. That's why she was transferring me to you.
Speaker1 : Yeah, I'm not. Entirely sure what the other representative was referring to. But I don't show that you have any active account. The only account that I show you have is a dependent care account and an Fsa account. But again, those accounts are now closed.
Speaker2 : Both. Okay, okay. that's all I need to know. I just wanted to make sure and see what had happened to it. It's been years. Thank you very much.

The card is not active, I don't think. We can go online and see that he has $610 available. But when trying to use the card to pay. A doctor's visit. It was not process. So He set up the account just a few minutes ago before he left the work. I helped him set it up. On the website and y'all keep asking him for a. For an employee number, like when he calls the number on the card to activate the card, but. He only has a blazer Id, which is all letters. He doesn't have a number and I don't know what number you're referring to. So when he tries to use the social. It's not allowing him, it's like you guys aren't taking his social, like you don't know the last four of his social. But the account has been set up online.

Speaker2 : This is just regarding a case that was created for you in reference to a payment that. Yes, it is in reference to a payment after you verify your telephone number, I'll be happy to advise you of. What's going on?
Speaker1 : 763. 352535 and All right, ma'am, thank you so much for this information. I was giving you a call in reference to a case that was created for you previously. I just wanted to make sure that this situation was handled for you. It looks like a case was created due to two separate payments being applied on different accounts.
Speaker2 : It looks like that there were for you and your husband.
Speaker1 : Yeah.
Speaker2 : So it looks like they are the same amount, so there is nothing to change. It looks like for future reference, just send those checks to us in separate envelopes with the individual coupons. It looks like you have your payment paid. So it looks all good. We received your payment yesterday and I understand you sent. Those payments on the 25th
Speaker1 : Yes, but that's for August. I sent you my payment for August and I had sent the payment for July. And they said that I didn't send the payment for July, but I had the canceled checks. From my bank account showing that it was. It was cashed in July.
Speaker2 : So
Speaker1 : I guess we were questioning why we got a letter saying that we didn't make a payment in July. When I have the canceled check. Both checks for July and they were cashed.
Speaker2 : So The last check that we received prior to the one that we received on the 30th. Was June 30.
Speaker1 : Yes, that was that was my payment for July 1.
Speaker2 : Yes, so that's the last payment that we received and that was for $44.10. So that covered you for June. We didn't receive another payment in July. So that is why your case was created. You are in. Let's see, let me just pull up. So we don't have a cash checked for July 1. That's why we had our team, this case was created for you. Our team double checked it for you. You have a check cash for June 30 and the check number is 15797. And Those were both applied to your accounts, but. That was for July. the last payment that I mean for June, the last payment that we received was applied to July. You can also view this information. It looks like you don't have access to the web portal. Maybe you do or do not, but you can also verify this on your online web portal. But the last two payments that we received, we applied to you and your husband's account. We did receive your most recent payment other than that. It looks like you owe for August 1.
Speaker1 : So I guess So Do you? what about so June, you didn't get a payment or you did?
Speaker2 : So we received a payment June 30. Prior to that
Speaker1 : June 1. For July 1.
Speaker2 : So it looks like. It looks like we received a check. It looks like we received a check March. We received a check in April. We received a check June. We didn't receive a check for May. So that is why your payment is not up to date. Your last payments were applied to the ongoing months. Your payments are correct. It looks like just for May we didn't receive a payment. Other than that, we've been receiving ongoing payments for the past year or so, but it looks like for May we didn't receive a payment. So that is why your most recent payment was applied to the month of July opposed to August because we didn't receive a payment for May. So you are up to date as of now, but due to the non payment for the month of May, that is why the last payments are being applied to the previous month. So when you send your next payment in for August, you will be up to date.
Speaker1 : Okay, so now that August payment is going to be late. Because If I get it in the mail today. How What do I use for a coupon then? I That I missed May and I don't have access to my bank account right now to find the check for that. So what do I use for? Coupon for me. How do I make sure I get credit?
Speaker2 : So you don't need to put the month of May, you don't need a specific coupon. You just need to make sure you include your member Id and your full name. So, e.g., your husband's account just include your member Id. I mean, for, I mean his member Id and his full name. Send the payment in us. Once we receive it, we apply it to the account. You'll be up to date, your payment is not late. Your payment is due within 30 days. So as long as you get that to us within a week or within the month, then that will be fine.
Speaker1 : Okay, okay, I thought we were looking for July. I'll have to check. Okay, I'll check on my May payment and get that to you.
Speaker2 : All right, any other questions?
Speaker1 : No.
Speaker2 : All right, thanks, Miss Johnson. Hope you have a great day.

Speaker1 : Okay. So I'm going to submit a case for this to be completed. It would just take me a few. Minutes Let's see. While I'm working on this, just in case we get disconnected, what's the best callback number for you so I can give you a call back?
Speaker2 : Sure 745 for 11081.
Speaker1 : All right, thank you. This won't take me long. Generally, cases. Can take up to three to five business days. But go ahead and get this submitted today. You will see it completed in your wallet. Let me get this going.
Speaker2 : Oh, so I won't have to do anything else. It'll complete itself.
Speaker1 : It should complete itself. That's the General process once we submit this case
Speaker2 : Okay.
Speaker1 : This would be a normal step. Let's see. All rights All right, so I have submitted this request. There should be nothing further to do. For you. Is there anything else I can help you with a review with you today?
Speaker2 : Yeah, one last question. I do buy some of my medical supplies, mandatory medical supplies, through Amazon. Will it let me use this card on Amazon?
Speaker1 : Let me double check. I know. Let's see. I know that. It definitely Can. I don't know if it's a, I don't know if it's, I don't know if some things will be restricted and you pay out of pocket, but I know, I know that it can work on Amazon. I just don't know if it's across the board.
Speaker2 : Okay. Yeah, for medical supplies. Like I have prescribed catheters that come not from Amazon, but then I buy the special lubrication. I buy that because it's cheaper on Amazon. And I was wondering if I could. It would work with that.
Speaker1 : Yeah. So it's going to be case by case. It's going to depend on the item and how Amazon has it coded. So if it doesn't work, it's because of that and not associated with any issue with the debit card. So it's just going to be a matter of seeing each.
Speaker2 : If the items work. Yeah. And if it doesn't, you would just pay out of the pocket and file for reimbursement. Let's see, you created a profile. Yeah. Yeah. So you just file a claim, include the receipt with that if it doesn't work. All right, thank you so much, ma'am. Have a blessed day. All right, you're welcome. Thank you too.
